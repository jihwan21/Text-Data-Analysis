"‘Love and Leashes,’ Girls’ Generation Seohyun’s debut film is about ...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000234356?sid=104,"Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:37:00 +0900","Actors of “Love and Leashes” Seohyun (right) and Lee Jun-young pose after an online press conference held on Tuesday. (Netflix)Seohyun of K-pop girl group Girls’ Generation has shed her image as a girl-next-door in her debut film “Love and Leashes,” a rom-com directed by Park Hyun-jin.“When I first read the script, it was fresh and shocking. It was a role that made me want to take up the challenge as an actor,” Seohyun said during an online press conference held on Tuesday. “Not only did it (the script) have a unique topic, it also showed how a man and a woman come to understand their differences.”Based on the webtoon “Moral Sense,” the film, a Netflix original, introduces Jung Ji-woo (played by Seohyun), an ordinary employee at a large conglomerate. She is great at her job, but sometimes has a hard time because her boss often criticizes her attitude -- not smiling when talking, for example.She has a crush on her co-worker, Jung Ji-hoo (played by Lee Jun-young), who is popular at work. One day, Ji-woo receives a package meant for Ji-hoo. Inside it, she finds a leash -- uncovering Ji-hoo’s unique sexual fetish. Director Park said she decided to adapt the webtoon into a film for two reasons.“When I first read the webtoon, I really enjoyed how it tells a story about sexual preference in a humorous and not too provocative way,” Park said. “Also, I really liked Jung Ji-woo. She does not have ‘aegyo’ (a Korean word used to describe babylike charm) so people consider her wooden. But Ji-hoo sees this side of Ji-woo as cool. When I saw these characters, I thought I could create a story that raises questions about society‘s stereotypical expectations of women.” At the press conference, Seohyun talked about how she would react if she accidentally finds out her crush’s secret, like Ji-woo in the movie.“I think it should be respected as long as it is not a crime. If the person does not want to talk about it, I would not force the conversation either. But I would tell my secret and try to show that it is OK to be different,” Seohyun said. “Love and Leashes” directed by Park Hyun-jin (Netflix)The K-pop girl band member said she was excited about her film being presented to audiences worldwide.“I think it is meaningful that our film is Netflix Korea’s first original movie,” Seohyun said. “I am curious to find out how global audiences from 190 different countries, as well as Korean audiences, will receive our film.” The Netflix movie will be released Feb. 11.

Third generation of girl groups looks to be marking end of an era,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035708?sid=106,"Sun, 05 Mar 2023 11:05:00 +0900","   Brave Girls disbanded on Feb. 16 as the four members' seven-year contracts expired. [BRAVE ENTERTAINMENT]     With a series of disbandments early on in the year, the third generation of K-pop girl groups seems to be coming to an end.      Girl group Brave Girls announced its disbandment on Feb. 16 as the members’ seven-year contracts expired, much to fans’ dismay. There was also a sense of bitterness among the general public, since Brave Girls had seen popularity ever since the group’s sleeper hit “Rollin’” (2017) swept the charts in early 2021, skyrocketing the group to stardom after years of obscurity.      Although the late-blooming success story touched many, and Brave Girls had been seen on countless TV shows and advertisements, the group quietly disbanded with just a digital single and no promotional activities.       Girl group Momoland debuted in 2016 and disbanded in January.[JOONGANG PHOTOS]     Shortly before that, girl group Momoland announced its contract expiration and disbandment on Jan. 27, which caused a mix of feelings among K-pop listeners as the group was widely known for its hit “Bboom Bboom” (2018).      Ironically at the same time, the news was no shock as most third-generation girl groups have already disbanded or been declining in popularity. After the two high-profile groups disbanded, anxiety loomed among fans of remaining third-generation girl groups — notably WJSN which just celebrated its seventh anniversary. After keeping fans on their toes for a while, it was announced on Friday that five out of the 13 members decided to depart, while the remaining eight renewed their contracts — avoiding disbandment but undergoing a change in its lineup.         Girl group WJSN debuted in 2016 and announced the departure of five members on March 3, shortly after celebrating the group's seventh anniversary. [STARSHIP ENTERTAINMENT]     The Korea Fair Trade Commission limits exclusive contracts to seven years at a time, in order to prevent excessively long contracts. As a result, groups which debuted in 2016 — the peak of third-generation debuts — face contract renewal with a high possibility of changes in the member lineup, if not disbandment altogether.           Who are the third-gen girl groups?   Third-generation K-pop acts generally refer to those who debuted sometime between 2013 and until the late 2010s. Those who debuted toward the end of the 2010s, such as girl group ITZY or boy band Tomorrow X Together in 2019, are often considered to be 3.5-generation.       Girl group AOA debuted in 2012 and was popular throughout the 2010s for its sensual concepts. [FNC ENTERTAINMENT]     Groups which debuted shortly before 2013 but rose in popularity later in the 2010s, like girl groups Apink and AOA or boy band Exo, are also considered part of the third generation.    Notable third-generation girl groups include Red Velvet, Mamamoo, Lovelyz, Laboum, Oh My Girl, Twice, GFriend, April, Blackpink, Dreamcatcher, gugudan, Weki Meki, DIA, (G)I-DLE and fromis_9, many of which have already disbanded.       Girl group GFriend debuted in 2015 and disbanded in 2021. [NEWS1]     What were their strategies?      Although numerous K-pop girl groups today sell hundreds of thousands of its physical albums, or even reach million-seller status, the 2010s was before K-pop CD sales skyrocketed.     Especially compared to boy bands who tend to have loyal fandoms willing to buy such collectibles, girl groups before the fourth generation of K-pop (circa 2020-) did not expect much in terms of CD sales but relied heavily on appealing to the general public with catchy melodies or personal beauty.    In order to gain popularity among the general public, girl groups of the time aimed to appeal to the male audience with a conventionally feminine image, ranging from cute and innocent to highly sensual concepts — a contrast from how most female K-pop acts after the late 2010s aim for a strong, charismatic image targeting the female fan base.       Girl group Le Sserafim debuted in 2022 and focuses on potraying a strong, independent image. It is considered one of the most successful fourth-generation K-pop acts. [NEWS1]     “General public” strategy backfires?      Although this strategy registered many third-generation girl groups as national sweethearts, it proved to be less efficient as time passed without the groups establishing core fan bases.    “Even if a group has a high public profile, there’s likely no sustainable revenue model if the group doesn’t have a loyal fandom willing to actually spend money,” said music critic Park Hee-a. “A song becoming popular among the general public is good too, but a loyal fandom buying a group’s CDs and merchandise is much more profitable. Boy bands usually do better than girl groups in this regard, while a number of fourth-generation girl groups like IVE, Le Sserafim and NewJeans have started catching up.”       Girl group IVE debuted in 2021 and has secured a loyal fandom. Its latest EP ""After Like"" sold over a million copies. [STARSHIP ENTERTAINMENT]     Since most third-generation girl groups’ strategies heavily relied on public appeal, their popularity usually declines as the members age, while fandoms tend to grow more invested with time — which is why many boy bands or even girl groups with loyal female fans are able to be active well after the seventh year.      A weak fandom also means that the group cannot afford any slips in terms of a new song’s chart performances. Brave Girls’ “Rollin’” and Momoland’s “Bboom Bboom” were both megahits in terms of streaming, but both groups were unable to produce a song as successful afterwards.         Girl group Lovelyz debuted in 2014 and disbanded in 2021. [WOOLLIM ENTERTAINMENT]     “Relying on producing a hit number, without following up with something as successful every single time, can be a risky a path to take,” critic Park added. “That’s why boy bands tend to last after they hit a certain orbit, because they’ve secured a fandom. Even if it’s not that large of a fan base, the support loyal fans send is less affected by each individual release. But for many girl groups which rely on public popularity, the failure of one song can be an immediate financial threat.”    The disbandment of widely-known girl groups, despite most of the public knowing who they are, is a result.           Fouth-generation shifts    Girl groups like Mamamoo or Red Velvet, which both debuted in 2014, are some of the few exceptions appealing to a more loyal female fandom with unique styles of music, rather than presenting a highly feminine image. The two also happen to be some of the few third-generation girl groups that are still thriving with large fandoms.     Blackpink and Dreamcatcher, which have been maintaining their strong “girl crush” concept since debuting in 2016 and 2017 respectively, as well as Twice, which pivoted to targeting more international and female fans years into its career, are some more examples.         Red Velvet during a press conference in 2022. The girl group debuted in 2014 and still flaunts a loyal fandom. [SM ENTERTAINMENT]     ""Not only the size, but also the demographic of a fandom is crucial,” said music critic Jung Min-jae. “It’s widely known that male fans are unlikely to spend money to support the artists they like, compared to female fans. Brave Girls and Momoland were well-known but their fandoms were predominantly male, which — honestly speaking — wasn’t helpful for those groups to be profitable and thus sustainable.”    “In contrast, we see many boy bands who are virtually unknown to the public make more profit and stay active longer thanks to a small but fervent core fandom,” continued Jung. “Now, we’re seeing fourth-generation girl groups take a similar fandom-centered strategy from the beginning and reaching million-sellers, without necessarily giving up on the public appeal aspect. Today we mainly see long-lasting boy bands, but I expect we will see an increasing number of long-lasting girl groups years later, coming from the fourth generation.”  "

Kakao reports big miss as growth engines hit profit,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000038000?sid=101,"Thu, 04 May 2023 12:01:00 +0900","  Kakao's office in Pangyo, Gyeonggi [YONHAP]     Kakao's net profit plummeted 93.4 percent on year to 87.1 billion won ($65.9 million) in the first quarter of 2023, the company blaming the high base effect due to a temporary surge in profit in 2022's first quarter as shares held for investment were sold. The figure fell far short of a market consensus of 126.2 billion won, as compiled by FnGuide. Operating profit fell 55.2 percent to 71.1 billion won, below analyst expectations of 122.7 billion won.    Sales were 1.74 trillion won, a 5.4 percent increase on year. The figure was below a market consensus of 1.83 trillion won.    The fall in operating profit was attributed to the building of redundancy in the company's data centers and increased spending on investment in new growth engines, such as in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud and healthcare.    The company blamed the economic slump and a fall in domestic sales from Kakao Games massively multiplayer online roleplaying game (MMORPG) Odin Valhalla Rising for the slow sales growth. Sales of ArcheAge War, a MMOPRG released in March, were not fully reflected in the first quarter.    Kakao CEO Hong Eun-taek explained that the company will continue to aggressively invest in new growth engine sectors to gain strong positioning in the respective industries and introduced a lineup of AI programs this year.     KakaoBrain will release an upgraded version of the Korean Generative Pre-trained Transformer (KoGPT) language model ""KoGPT 2.0"" by the latter half of the year. KoGPT 2.0 was initially scheduled for release in the first half of this year.    Upgraded versions of AI image generation model Karlo 2.0 will be released sometime this month.    Kakao Healthcare will release a business-to-business (B2B) digital service in which research centers and healthcare businesses can utilize data from medical centers by the second quarter.    In business-to-consumer (B2C) areas, the company will release a platform to offer daily life solutions for patients with diabetes or in need of checking their blood sugar levels by the fourth quarter. The platform will analyze daily life patterns with AI and offer specific solutions, such as tips on their diet and exercise.    ""We believe this year's annual operating loss for our new initiatives will rise higher than we've seen in previous years, to a maximum 300-billion-won loss,"" said Kakao Chief Investment Officer and Executive Vice President Bae Jae-hyun in an online conference call Thursday.    ""This is going to be a peak for our AI-related investment. At earliest, related costs will dwindle down by the latter half of this year, or will be dramatically reduced by next year.""   "
SK Hynix sets up image sensor R\&D center in Tokyo to challenge Sony’s d...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0004463044?sid=004,"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 15:19:00 +0900"," South Korea’s SK Hynix has set up an image sensor research center in Japan, a powerhouse in the field of imaging sensor chips led by Sony Corporation. The world’s No. 2 memory chip maker aims to leverage its R&D resource there to attract top research talent and close its technology gap with global players in the system semiconductor, according to industry sources on Tuesday. The new research center named Japan CIS R&D Center is located in Tokyo and will be led by Masayuki Shimura, who had worked at Sony for 18 years from 1997. He also worked at Huawei before joining SK Hynix as research head for next-generation image sensor technology. The research center is designed to take advantage of various R&D resources across Japan and joint research projects with universities in Japan will contribute to the company’s image sensor business, said Shimura. SK Hynix currently runs two image sensor production lines at Icheon and Cheongju sites in Korea. Part of its DRAM lines was converted into a line for image sensors this year to meet the growing market needs while adjusting production of DRAMs against oversupply.  Image sensors sales account for a mere 2 to 3 percent of SK Hynix's total revenue, with most of its products for 13 million-pixel mobile devices. SK Hynix is planning to respond to the demand for high-capacity mobile devices by expanding its line up by adding 16 million-pixel products this year and up to 48 million-pixel products next year.Demand for image sensors are on a sharp rise as more businesses look for high-end digital camera in various applications powered by disruptive technologies such as 5G mobile communication, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. According to market research firm TSR, the global image sensor market is expected to grow from $13.3 billion last year to $24.4 billion in 2023.The global market is dominated by Sony and Samsung Electronics with 49.9 percent and 19.6 percent market share, respectively last year, according to IHS Markit. SK Hynix ranked fourth in the market with a 5.6 percent market share.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]		"
Girls' Generation in crisis,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000192974?sid=104,"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:24:00 +0900","From left: Sooyoung , Seohyun and Tiffany (Herald DB)Having reached the 10-year mark, which is very rare for any K-pop act, Girls’ Generation is considered a textbook example of how to succeed in the K-pop industry. The iconic group’s influence is enormous, notching countless awards and numerous hits. The revelation Monday night that three members of Girls‘ Generation are leaving their agency raises questions about the group‘s future: Will the group weather the storm intact or will it be the final straw for this legendary brand? On Monday evening, S.M. Entertainment confirmed local media reports which claimed that members Tiffany, Seohyun and Sooyoung did not renew their contracts with the label while the other five -- Taeyeon, Yoona, Yuri, Hyoyeon and Sunny -- have decided to remain with the agency.The agency said in a statement, “Girls’ Generation is a precious and meaningful group for both S.M. and fans,” adding that the members are not considering disbandment at all and that it will carefully discuss the future of group with the remaining members. The news came as a shock to many, as the act had released its sixth full-length album “Holiday Night” in August to commemorate its 10th anniversary, giving the impression that the members‘ strong bond would last forever. According to media reports, California-born-and-raised Tiffany is expected to pursue her studies in the US, while Seohyun and Sooyoung will pursue acting careers following their split from the agency. It was previously reported that Tiffany has been growing a passion for acting for several years, and plans to study acting in the US. Sooyoung and Seohyun, who have been in several TV drama series, are currently starring in TV drama “Man Who Sets The Table” and “Thief, thief,” respectively. Seohyun has also featured in multiple musicals.With three of its members venturing into solo careers -- one of them leaving Korea -- speculations have been rising that their departure will soon lead to the group’s disbandment. Girls’ Generation may manage to stay intact from the blow, but whether the five-member structure will hold as much momentum as before also remains a question. Other popular girl groups such as Wonder Girls and Sistar broke up entirely after having lost its members or seeing some members choose a solo career over group activities. However, it is too early to make any assumptions about the group’s future, as another scenario in which the members can gather in groups or as a whole for project activities is still possible, following in the footsteps of long-running K-pop acts such as Shinhwa and g.o.d. Girls‘ Generation (S.M. Entertainment)After its contract with S.M. Entertainment expired in 2003, the members of Shinhwa, who got together in 1998 making it the longest-running K-pop group to date, embarked on solo careers either as actors or singers under different agencies. Then in 2011, all six original members joined in establishing its own agency, Shinhwa Company, to allow for activities as a group alongside their solo careers. Such effort to stay together enabled Shinhwa to release its impressive 13th album “Unchanging” in October last year without losing any of its members. g.o.d, one of the most popular K-pop bands of the early 2000s, is another group that has managed to remain relevant. The group went into hiatus in 2006 after Yoon Kye-sang left the group in 2004 to pursue acting. But in 2014, all five members, who were on different paths under different agencies, reunited to drop its eighth full-length album “Chapter 8” to celebrate its 15th anniversary. Since debuting in 2007 with the first single “Into the New World,” an energetic pop rock track filled with hopes and dreams that fit the group’s youthful image, Girls’ Generation has become a leader in K-pop industry. The group was credited for setting genre trends with its bubblegum hits and flirty pop style, especially after performing its breakout hit “Gee” in skinny jeans with vibrant colors in 2009, which later became an infectious fashion trend.Along with hits such as “Genie,” “Oh!” and “Run Devil Run” in mid-2009 and early 2010, the act’s fourth full-length album “I Got a Boy” in 2013 was also a huge success, claiming the top spot on Billboard‘s World Albums Chart. After the departure of Jessica Jung in 2014 the group returned as an eight-piece and released a slew of hits, including “Lion Heart” and its latest anniversary album “Holiday Night,” which debuted at No.1 on Billboard’s World Albums chart in June. Along with group activities, members Taeyeon, Tiffany, Seohyun and Hyoyeon have also made headway in their solo careers, while other members have appeared on the small screen and on variety shows, contributing to the longevity of the group.

"When it comes to artistic creation, is AI a friend or foe?",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035457?sid=103,"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 13:30:00 +0900","  A text-to-image AI Dall-E2 generated image with a prompt: Edward Hopper-style image of a man and a woman sitting at a cafe table, both absorbed in their smartphones without speaking. [MOON SO-YOUNG]      “A man and a woman sitting at a cafe table, both absorbed in their smartphones without speaking, in Edward Hopper style.”    Upon entering the command in English to text-to-image generation website Dall-E2, four images were created in just over a minute. While evoking the wide expanses of color, spaciousness and a lonely atmosphere of the British painter’s iconic work “Nighthawks,” the resulting image was more than a mere imitation but a unique artwork.    It was a moment that confirmed the ongoing concern that AI is posing a threat to the field of artistic creation.    Will an AI be smart enough to know the Queen Seondeok of Korea’s Silla Dynasty (57 B.C. to A.D. 935) and generate her image correctly?        Midjourney generated image of Queen Seondoek of Silla in Alphonse Mucha style [MOON SO-YOUNG]      “Queen Seondeok Silla, an ancient kingdom of Korea, wearing a red hanbok [Korean traditional dress] and a golden crown of Silla, in an Art Nouveau painter Alphonse Mucha style.”    This time, this reporter utilized Midjourney, another text-to-image generation app similar to OpenAI’s Dall-E2. A faint image started to appear as soon as the enter key was pressed. Within 40 seconds, four complete drawings were generated, depicting intricate details such as facial expressions, hair and even the big folds in drapery. The quality of the images was so high that they could be used immediately as illustrations for a fantasy web novel.    The emergence of ChatGPT, which can write speeches for politicians or solve medical exam questions with ease, has sparked a global phenomenon, with over 100 million users utilizing its services. Different AI programs that challenge human activities have been emerging one after another in recent years.    “AI has reached a stage where it seems to have its own sensibility by predicting elements that humans like and are moved by, based on vast data learning to create text and images,” said Yiyun Kang, a media artist and an assistant professor at KAIST. ChatGPT may still be in its early stages, but it is already writing poetry and novels that touch on human emotions. There’s even AI that composes music.    The paintings created by AI are ultimately a collection of imitations based on data learning. However, even among creative artists, there are those who use AI or collaborate with it in their creative activities.    “The world where AI does everything has arrived.”    This is the title of a YouTube video uploaded by a famous Korean webtoon artist Joo Ho-min last October. As AI that can draw pictures from text input surpasses the realm of creative activities once considered unique to humans, Joo initiated a live discussion with his viewers to talk about how much of a threat this poses to creators such as webtoon artists. Video content related to such issues has been rapidly increasing on social media over the past few months.    The big three AI image generators — Dall-E2 and Midjourney from the U.S. and Stable Diffusion from the UK — made a stir as they were introduced to the public one after another last summer. In particular, webtoon and game industry insiders in Korea were shocked by the emergence of Noble AI, which produces high-quality Japanese anime-style images based on Stable Diffusion technology.    Is the quality that high to shock the professionals?    According to the official website of Dall-E2, the AI developed by OpenAI, a U.S.-based research institute that also created the conversational AI service ChatGPT, is named after the surrealist artist Salvador Dali and Pixar’s Wall-E. Dall-E uses the underlying AI language model GPT-3, which was trained on a massive amount of text data to learn how to use language in various ways and applies this knowledge to generate images. It was first released in early 2021 and an upgraded version has been available to the public since the second half of 2022.    As for the quality of the images produced by the AI, it’s definitely high enough to threaten professionals in the webtoon and game industry. Dall-E can be easily accessed if you already have a Google ID. In the first month, users are provided with 50 credits for free, which allows them to generate 50 images. After that, 15 credits will be provided every month for free. If users wish to use more, they can purchase additional credits. To generate an image, users can simply enter a prompt describing the desired image in the input field and press the “generate” button. As the AI on the website does not understand Korean, prompts should be written in English to generate images.    Will the AI be able to generate editorial cartoons for newspapers? Let’s give it a try.      An illustration of members of parliament generated by Dall-E2 [MOON SO-YOUNG]     Upon entering “Illustrations of bickering members of parliament” and clicking on the generate button, it took about a minute for four illustrations in the style of editorial cartoons to appear. While the details such as the hand gestures were a bit exaggerated, the overall atmosphere was well captured and could be used in editorial pages or for political commentary videos. If you don’t like any of the images, you can click on the generate button once again to get a new set.        Images of Geobukseon (turtle ship) that turned into a mechanical and futuristic spaceship generated by Midjourney [MOON SO-YOUNG]      This reporter decided to challenge the AI and entered prompts such as “A cute rabbit wearing hanbok” and “A geobukseon [turtle ship] that turned into a mechanical and futuristic spaceship.”      Dall-E2-generated image of hanbok-wearing rabbits [MOON SO-YOUNG]     The hanbok-wearing rabbit prompt generated relatively satisfying images, including photographs and 3-D rendering images. However, the images generated for the spaceship-turned-geobukseon prompt did not reflect the real appearance of the geobukseon, or the Korean warships otherwise known as turtle ship, that are well-known to all Koreans.    Lee Tak-yeon, an assistant professor of Industrial Design at KAIST, who also leads an AI-Experience Lab, explained that this may be due to the AI not having any data on Korea’s geobukseon or due to an inaccurate description of the prompt. One user also commented that the text-to-image AI programs seem to lack “data training on Asian culture.”    The most high-quality images were generated for the following two prompts: “A modern city covered in volcanic ash clouds after a volcanic explosion nearby in oriental painting style” and “A man and a woman sitting at a cafe table, both absorbed in their smartphones without speaking in Edward Hopper style.”    But not all AIs showed the same competence for the same prompts.    When the result for the latter prompt on Dall-E2 was jaw-dropping, the same prompt on Midjourney generated a one-dimensional composite image of a man and a woman holding smartphones.    When the same prompt to generate an image of a “geobukseon turned into a spaceship” was asked on Midjourney, it only generated four images that looked like a turtle with a submarine-like structure — far from anything that resembled a spaceship or geobukseon. Despite adding detailed descriptions of a turtle ship, such as a ship with “sharp iron spikes protruding from hexagonal plates covering the top of the ship,” or “a dragon head on the bow of the vessel,” the AI kept generating increasingly bizarre images, clearly showcasing it did not understand what geobukseon was. One notable feature of Midjourney was, however, that even the strangest images it generated had sophistication.    One of the defining characteristics of Midjourney is its ability to create illustrations that resemble those found in science fiction and fantasy games. In August, an image created by Midjourney won first place in the digital art competition at the Colorado State Fair, sparking a debate whether AI-generated art can be considered a form of creative work.        Video artist Jason Allen's Midjourney generated piece called “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” won first place at the Colorado State Fair. [JASON ALLEN]      The quality of the image generated by the AI exceeded the expectations of the people and had the potential to significantly disrupt the illustration industry.    “Illustrators who only perform relatively simple tasks are at high risk of losing their jobs due to such AI but at the same time, they have great potential to utilize AI to do better,” said Prof. Lee. “They can use the images generated by AI as assets and add their final touch, which can help them complete five to 10 projects a day compared to doing one a day.”    Webtoon artist Joo also said in the video he posted that he doesn’t think creators of webtoons will be threatened by such AI.    “However, it is highly likely that assistant illustrators who help webtoon artists to draw backgrounds and color are likely to be replaced by such AI,” he said as he introduced an “out painting” function in Dall-E2.    This function allows the user to upload a painting, such as the 17th-century masterpiece “Girl with a Pearl Earring,” with an input text describing a scene where the girl is standing in a kitchen outside the original painting. The AI will then generate a new image that shows the entire figure of the girl standing in the kitchen with similar shading and texture to the original.    Professor Lee explained that the activities of content creators such as authors, educators, YouTubers and web novelists are expected to become much more abundant. In the past, even simple illustrations for content had to be commissioned from illustrators or purchased one by one from image stock companies, but now they can be created with AI. Of course, this will affect professional illustrators, but they should actively utilize AI to increase the quality and quantity of their works, or focus on creating works tailored to clients’ detailed demands, which AI is not yet fully capable of.    Professor Lee has been insisting through his research that AI can be a partner to human creators rather than a competitor.    “In our lab, we have invited six beginner illustrators and four hobby illustrators and four professionals and asked them to work with Dall-E2. We’ve been studying whether they perceive the image-generating AI as a colleague, assistant or just a tool,” said Lee. “The professional illustrators tend to regard Dall-E2 as a search engine that provides reference materials and they really like it when the AI creates images that they had not thought of as they will use them as material to create their final works,” Lee added, explaining that this may be the way for AI and professional illustrators to ultimately coexist, allowing humans to preserve their creativity.    Collaboration between humans and AI, however, can raise copyright issues.    Kathleen Kim, a New York-qualified attorney who specializes in art law, said, “Only humans can be the subject of creation under the copyright law, therefore, AI is unlikely to be a copyright holder and may not be protected as a copyrighted work. However, if a human artist is the subject of creative activity and simply uses AI’s capabilities as a tool, the copyright for the resulting work may belong to the artist. Therefore, it can be determined whether the work is protected as a copyrighted work depending on the extent of human intervention and AI intervention.”    However, Kim added that AI has a degree of agency that is incomparable to past computer programs, so the legal profession is struggling with how to accommodate it.    “It is safe to say that we’re heading into a completely new era,” Kim said.

“Promoting Young Buddhist Culture with Splendid Paintings of Bodhidharm...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/032/0003225068?sid=104,"Mon, 22 May 2023 17:27:00 +0900","Artist, Jo Jae-yun, who wants the younger generation to be attracted to Bodhidharma and Buddhism, displays his Pop Art Bodhidharma series, a fresh interpretation of the image of Bodhidharma, which the Korean public is familiar with in ink paintings, in the form of Pop art. Su Sung-il, Senior ReporterThe image of Bodhidharma, which the Korean public is used to seeing in ink paintings, has been reinterpreted in the form of Pop art. The Pop Art Bodhidharma series, which portrays Bodhidharma with a stern face wearing splendid clothes clearly displaying luxury brand logos, is the work of Pop artist, Jo Jae-yun (44). Jo is also an electronic dance music (EDM) artist performing under the name of Badboss.The painting of Bodhidharma is a Buddhist painting of the great monk who founded Zen Buddhism and introduced Buddhism to East Asia. Jo, along with five other artists, is taking part in a special exhibition, Why Bodhidharma Came to Seochon, in commemoration of Buddha’s Birthday, at 259 Nuha-dong located in Seochon, Jongno-gu, Seoul until May 29.Jo’s works are mainly a collage of various textiles, including gift-wrapping cloth from the traditional holidays and the leather of luxury brands, with watercolor paintings. When we met him at the gallery on May 18, Jo explained, “The luxury brand logos I painted around Bodhidharma is the greed that exists in the world,” and added, “The halo behind Bodhidharma’s head expresses an image of a virtuous monk who blocked out worldly greed.” Meanwhile, the extravagant clothes the great Buddhist monk is wearing was an attempt by the artist to attract the attention of the younger generation to Bodhidharma and to Buddhism.Jo learned to paint Bodhidharma and the Four Gracious Plants (plum blossom, orchid, chrysanthemum, bamboo) when he was in elementary school. The artist was born into a devout Buddhist family in Jinju, Gyeongsangnam-do and lived in a Buddhist temple until he turned nineteen along with his grandmother, who was the founder of the temple, and his uncle, who won a prize in the National Art Contest with a painting of Bodhidharma.“I would get up in the morning and begin the day beating a wooden bell and chanting Buddhist prayers with the monks. In my twenties, I had a hard time changing my habit of putting my hands together whenever I met someone,” the artist said laughing.Jo said, “Bodhidharma was a monk I had always seen since I was young, so he is very familiar to me,” and mentioned how he constantly drew the Buddhist monk in the pages of his textbook, workbook, and notebook.His family wanted him to renounce the world and become a monk, but influenced by Michael Jackson and Seo Taiji, he studied music composition at Chung-Ang University. After graduating, he worked as musician and EDM artist writing songs and lyrics for the original soundtrack of TV dramas, such as Rude Miss Young-ae on tvN.Jo began to seriously paint in 2020. At the time, he was suffering from depression after his work collapsed due to COVID-19, and he followed the advice of his friends and began painting again.He was able to hold his first solo exhibition after a person from an art gallery saw his work. The exhibit displayed 38 pieces of work including the Pop Art Bodhidharma series. Among the works on display, his homage to Andy Warhol’s 32 “Campbell’s Soup Cans,” the “30 Cans of Richam” was popular among the public. He also drew attention for donating all of his proceeds from his paintings for the treatment of patients suffering from hard-to-cure diseases.The Pop Art Bodhidharma can be seen at Buddhist temples including Jogyesa, Bongeunsa and Tongdosa, as well as at Dongguk University. Jo said, “I donated the works because I wanted to introduce Buddhism and Bodhidharma to many people.” He further said, “It really encouraged me when even conservative monks looked at my work and gave positive feedback saying, ‘Buddhism needs to grow younger, too.’”Jo also released Pop art portraits of great people. On Independence Movement Day on March 1, he donated his portrait of the independence activist and patriot, An Jung-geun--reinterpreted in Pop art using fabrics from Gucci and Louis Vuitton--to the An Jung-geun Memorial Museum.Last year, he donated the portrait of another patriot, Ahn Chang-ho, to the Seodaemun Prison History Hall. He is currently working on another piece on the theme of Kim Gu in time for National Liberation Day on August 15.Jo plans to continue his work in the Pop Art Bodhidharma series. He said, “I want to tell people through my work that religion is not just a serious topic,” and added, “I hope the exhibit gives people a chance to come to the gallery, regardless of religion, and enjoy the artwork and learn more about Buddhism.”		"
[WHY] Is Kim Ju-ae North Korea's heir apparent?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000033563?sid=100,"Sat, 07 Jan 2023 07:00:00 +0900","  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, right, and his daughter Ju-ae inspect a missile facility at an unspecified location in North Korea, in a photo released by state media on Jan. 1, 2023. [YONHAP]     On New Year’s Day, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made an appearance on state television viewing an array of weapons at a missile base in an undisclosed location.      What really caught the world’s attention was not the Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles or transporter erector launcher (TEL) at the site, but the fact that Kim was hand-in-hand with his second child.      This was the young girl’s third appearance. Her first was with her father at a test of Pyongyang’s new Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Nov. 18, 2022.      That was the first time any of Kim’s offspring were shown to the public.      The daughter's latest appearance is fueling speculation on whether Kim is setting her up as his heir apparent.      Children of North Korea’s ruling dynasty have traditionally been kept from public view until they reached adulthood. Mystery is part of the personality cult of the Kim family, also known as the Mount Paektu bloodline.      In her second appearance at an event celebrating the ICBM launch later in November, high-ranking North Korean officials were photographed bowing to the daughter — as she stood straight — showing notable reverence to her.      North Korean state media described this daughter as Kim Jong-un’s “most beloved” child, though it never revealed her name or age. South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said she is believed to be named Kim Ju-ae, and is around nine or 10 years old.    Ju-ae resembles both of her parents and is dressed with notable style.      Like her mother Ri Sol-ju, Ju-ae appears to be emerging as a new style icon and the leader of the younger generation of North Koreans.      Some analysts see Ju-ae’s public appearances as an attempt to solidify the regime's security.      Others tentatively suggest that Ju-ae may be cementing her role as heir apparent to carry on a fourth generation of the Kim dynasty and someday take control of the North’s nuclear weapons.        North Korean leader Kim Jong-un holds hands with his daughter Ju-ae as they prepare to watch the launch of a new Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at Pyongyang International Airport on Nov. 18 in a photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Nov. 19, 2022. [YONHAP]    Who is Kim Jong-un’s 'most beloved' child?   Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju are believed to have married in 2009 and have three children born around 2010, 2013 and 2017. The first is believed to be a son and the two others are daughters.      Ju-ae is the only one of Kim Jong-un’s three kids that we have a name for thanks to retired NBA star Dennis Rodman. Rodman revealed to the media in September 2013 he held Kim's baby girl in his arms after a visit to Pyongyang on the invitation of the North Korean leader earlier in the year, revealing her name for the first time.    The world got its first look at Ju-ae on Nov. 19, 2022, in a series of photos released by state media. She was observing the Hwasong-17 ICBM test the previous day.      The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Kim was ""together with his beloved daughter and wife"" to take part in ""a crucial milestone” in the regime’s nuclear development. It did not specify the daughter’s name or age.      Her appearance overshadowed Pyongyang’s boast that it had launched a Hwasong-17 — an ICBM dubbed the ""monster"" missile with a range of around 15,000 kilometers, which would put the United States mainland within its range.    The South’s spy agency NIS later confirmed that the child in the photos was believed to be Kim Ju-ae, the North Korean leader’s second child.      On Nov. 27, the state-run Rodong Sinmun released 15 photos of Ju-ae on its front and second pages, this time with officials who worked on the launch of the Hwasong-17.      The father and daughter pair was affectionately holding hands. In two photographs, Ju-ae places her hand on her seated father’s shoulder, an act of intimacy expected only from closest family members.    In her latest appearance in images released by the North’s Korean Central Television on Jan. 1, she is visiting a missile base at an unspecified location with her father, viewing what appears to be over a dozen Hwasong-12 IRBMs and other missiles.      The images were shown in a report on the results of the North’s ruling Workers' Party plenary meeting held from Dec. 26 to 31.      Unification Ministry spokesman Cho Joong-hoon confirmed to reporters on Jan. 2 that Kim’s daughter has been featured in the North Korean media three times and that Seoul would continue to “monitor and evaluate related trends” of coverage of Kim Ju-ae.      Kim Ju-ae poses with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at a photo session with missile officials involved in the Hwasong-17 ICBM launch in a photo released by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Nov. 27, 2022. [YONHAP]    Why reveal Ju-ae now?     In September 2022, a video clip of a young girl in a pink dress and short hair at the center of a children’s choir at an event celebrating North Korea’s 74th founding anniversary attended by Kim and Ri caught South Korean and western media’s attention.      The video showed Kim smiling widely and Ri wrapping her hand around the child's back after the performance, raising speculation that this could be Kim’s daughter.        A video clip from state media of a young girl in a pink dress at the center of a children’s choir at an event celebrating North Korea’s 74th founding anniversary attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and wife Ri Sol-ju on Sept. 8, 2022, led to speculation on whether she could be Ju-ae. [KCNA]    The big reveal came two months later.      “Exposing a member of the Kim family is a strategic choice that has to be carefully planned or determined to be necessary; there is simply no accidental or spontaneous exposure,” said Hong Min, director of the North Korean Research Division at Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU).    “In the case of the ‘royal family,’ not only are there issues of personal safety, but once revealed, it’s not just an internal security issue, but various foreign intelligence agencies can mark them and monitor their every move.”    But despite the risks, Hong pointed out that publicizing the father-daughter relationship has a “considerable image-making effect” and also brings the leader closer to the North Korean people.    “Through showing stability in his family, he is also guaranteeing the safety and security of the future generations,” or the so-called “market generation,” those born after 2010.      “It shows they have a weapon that can secure the future of the country,” said Hong, “and presents an image of the head of a family and a leader who is guaranteeing the safety of all North Koreans and their children.”      Appearing with his daughter at the missile site also “softens the belligerent military image,” said Hong, and “provides a justification for developing missiles and having nuclear weapons.”      North Korea described the successful test of the Hwasong-17 last November as a “historic day,” and Kim Jong-un brought along his second child, pointed out Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute.    “Kim Jong-un wanted to show off the great achievement of the successful test of the Hwasong-17 ICBM, and I believe he naturally tried to link loyalty to himself with loyalty to his daughter,” said Cheong.    “It's not like he took his daughter out to an on-site inspection out of the blue,” said Cheong. “Kim Ju-ae was brought out on an historical day, and officials in the related fields pledged in a letter their loyalty from generation to generation to the Mount Paektu bloodline. So, naturally, Kim intended to instill an image that his daughter would succeed his achievements.”      Kim Ju-ae and her mother Ri Sol-ju. [YONHAP]    How did Ju-ae become an overnight style icon?   In her Nov. 18 sighting, Ju-ae looked like a typical elementary school girl, sporting a padded jacket with a white fur collar over black pants. She had straight bangs, hair tied back with a blue scrunchie. For a fun pop of color, she had red patent leather shoes with bows.      The first thing many people noted was her remarkable resemblance to her father.    In her second appearance, she sported a more mature look, donning a black woolen coat with a black fur collar, similar to a style worn by her mother Ri Sol-ju, the reigning style icon for the Pyongyang elite.      Ju-ae’s bangs were swept to the side, and her hair styled in a half-up do, Ri’s signature look, drawing attention this time to the resemblance between mother and daughter. Kim Jong-un also sported an all-black look on that occasion, wearing a black leather double-breasted trench coat.      In her New Year’s Day appearance, Ju-ae again is dressed in a long black coat, black trousers and black leather shoes, with her half-up hairstyle, similar to her second appearance.    The white puffer jacket Ju-ae wore on her first appearance reportedly sparked a padded jacket boom in North Korea.      In early December, the Rodong Sinmun published pictures of North Korean women in white and pink padded jackets, indicating that Ju-ae was a trendsetter following in her mother's footsteps.    “Kim Jong-un daughter” was the most popular search term related to North Korea in Google search engines globally in the days after her public appearances, catapulting her to worldwide fame.      Experts point out that Kim’s styles varied according to the occasion, and that Ju-ae sported a more casual look for the missile test, and more formal attire for the commemorative photo.      “What's certain is that such outfits weren't mere personal preferences,” said Hong Min, director of the North Korean Research Division at Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU). “There must have been coordination, similar to how Ri Sol-ju's clothes are similarly coordinated depending on the event location and various other things.”    He pointed out that this publicity and image-making, down to Ju-ae’s outfits, was likely meticulously coordinated by Kim Yo-jong, the leader’s powerful younger sister in charge of propaganda.      “Once revealed, it is not a one-time exposure, but with the intention to fully utilize Kim Ju-ae for image politics for government activities.”      A compilation of North Korean first lady Ri Sol-ju’s outfits. [YONHAP]    Who is Ri Sol-ju, North Korea’s first lady?   Before she became North Korea’s first lady, Ri was best known as a cheerleader, a very competitive position, who traveled to South Korea for the 2005 Asian Athletics Championship in Incheon.      Ri is reported to have come from an upper-class family. Her exact age is unknown, though she is assumed to be in her early to mid-30s. She was a singer in the Unhasu Orchestra, an elite troupe of handpicked musicians, before she married Kim Jong-un around 2009.      As first lady, Ri also went through a style transformation and is credited with popularizing Western-style attire, miniskirts, luxury bags and high heels.    Ri was immediately noted for her exceptional beauty in South Korea, and compared to the North’s version of a K-pop star.    In her earliest appearances, Ri was often seen wearing modest black skirted suits, considered typical for the Pyongyang female elite. She wore a short haircut before adopting her signature long-haired, half-up do.      She began donning pastel colors, skirt suits reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy, brighter patterns, floral prints, statement accessories and luxury brand bags, including Dior.    Ri is often credited for a boom in fake luxury bags, and brighter colors and patterns also caught on with Pyongyang women, according to defectors, who said that bright fabrics similar to Ri’s outfits sold out quickly.      Ri’s fashion choices were also seen to be linked to Kim Jong-un’s focus on improving his country’s economy after coming into power.      A senior North Korean military official is seen bowing to Kim Ju-ae at the commemorative photo shoot in a screen capture from the North’s Korean Central Television on Nov. 27. [YONHAP]    What is the Mount Paektu bloodline?   The so-called Mount Paektu bloodline refers to the North Korean ruling family. The Kim dynasty dates to founding father Kim Il Sung, and after he died in 1994, North Korea was run by his son Kim Jong-il and then his grandson Kim Jong-un.      Mount Paektu, an active volcano straddling the North Korean-Chinese border, is considered the spiritual home of the Korean people. The Mount Paektu bloodline is a major part of the personality cult of Kim Il Sung and his successors, and three generations of Kims were officially born on the mountain, though historical accounts contradict that claim.      Kim's children are comparable to “princes or princesses in a dynastic system,” said Cheong.      Senior military brass are seen bowing low to Ju-ae at the Nov. 27 photo event, showing her status as Kim’s daughter surpasses that of four-star generals much older than her.      “What really surprised me is that four-star generals bowed 90 degrees to Kim Ju-ae,” People Power Party (PPP) Rep. Thae Yong-ho, a former senior North Korean diplomat who defected to the South, told SBS radio later that month. “North Korea is similar to the South, based on Confucian tradition, and this would not happen even for the children [of the Kim dynasty], at least not during Kim Il Sung’s time.”    He said Ju-ae’s appearance “seems to be an opportunity to firmly carve out the fourth generation of succession.”      Why the secrecy?   Kim Jong-il was named heir-apparent to North Korean founder Kim Il Sung in 1974 but was officially designated his father's successor at a ruling Workers' Party meeting six years later in 1980.    Kim Jong-il named Kim Jong-un his successor in 2008, but he made his first appearance in the media two years later.    His father told his closest aides that Kim Jong-un would be his successor since 1992, after his son’s eighth birthday, because he resembled him the most. Kim Jong-il passed over his first born son, Kim Jong-nam, and second, Kim Jong-chol, in favor of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had a different mother than the other two sons, so he was their half-brother.    Kim Jong-chol and Kim Jong-un spent their adolescent years at an elite boarding school in Bern, Switzerland. They were left in the care of maternal aunt Ko Yong-suk, and her husband, Ri Gang. Ko, Ri and their three children later defected to the United States.      Kim Jong-nam fell out of favor with his father in the early 2000s after a visit to Tokyo Disneyland in 2001 that produced embarrassing headlines around the world. He was assassinated with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia in February 2017.      “It took a lot of time for Kim Jong-un to overcome the prejudices of the outside world and questions about regime stability when he took power,” said Cheong. “However, there will be no such talk if his successor is appointed early on.”      North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, right, and daughter Ju-ae watch the launch of a new Hwasong-17 ICBM at Pyongyang International Airport on Nov. 18 in a photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency on Nov. 19, 2022. [YONHAP]    Who will succeed Kim?     Some analysts point out that the hidden first child, or son, is likely to be Kim’s heir apparent and will be kept out of the public eye until he grows older, as Kim Jong-un was.      They note that Kim himself is still young, not yet 40, leaving a lot of time to formally name a successor.      “Kim Jong-un is a young leader, who will likely rule the country for more than 20 years taking into consideration his age,” said Hong. “He needs to be reaching the current young generation, teenagers and those in their 20s, and 30s, the people that will become the central pillars of North Korean society in the future.”    Hong was skeptical that Ju-ae is the heir apparent, noting that North Korea “in general is patriarchal,” and that “despite society changing in many ways, it is still a country where the differences between men and women are very severe.”    He said that the first son is likely to be Kim’s successor.      However, it’s not unheard of for North Korea to have powerful female officials.      Other prominent female figures include Kim’s younger sister and closest aide Kim Yo-jong, the first vice director of its propaganda department, who often serves as a mouthpiece for her brother, and Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, who was responsible for denuclearization negotiations.      Kim Kyong-hui, the once powerful aunt of Kim Jong-un, was the only legitimate daughter of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung and wielded immense influence during the Kim Jong-il era. Her husband, Jang Song-thaek, a former vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, was executed in late 2013 for allegedly plotting to overthrow the regime, which put Kim Kyong-hui out of the spotlight for some years before she made reappeared in 2020.      “Kim Ju-ae can have a role to assist her father's governing activities, and a role to assist her brother, who later becomes his successor,” said Hong, similar to the role Kim Yo-jong plays today. “She can serve as an icon of her generation.”      However, Cheong pointed out that there were only three previous people described as “precious” before Ju-ae. They were former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong-il, and the current leader Kim Jong-un.      “This suggests that Kim Ju-ae will soon become the fourth-generational leader,” he said, and “it can be interpreted that she has been chosen to succeed her father.”      Ju-ae is described in North Korean state media as Kim’s “most beloved” child, literally meaning she is his favorite of his three offspring, he pointed.      “The reason Kim Jong-un was chosen as the successor to Kim Jong-il is because Kim Jong-il loved him the most amongst his sons,” said Cheong. “Even if Kim Jong-un’s first child is a son, if he doesn’t have the temperament, or is considered soft like the music-loving Kim Jong-chol, or weak [like Kim Jong-nam], it would be difficult for the North Korean leader to name such a son as his successor. However, even if Kim Ju-ae is a daughter, if she has strong fighting power, she could be the logical choice for him.”      North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his daughter Ju-ae inspect a missile facility at an unspecified location in North Korea, in a photo released by state media on Jan. 1, 2023. [YONHAP]    What next for Ju-ae?   Whether or not Ju-ae is indeed Kim’s successor, her every move will be scrutinized from now on.      “In light of his own experience, Kim may have decided on a successor and disclosed it early on to make it is less shocking to people and provide an opportunity for his successor to form a wider network of people around her,” said Cheong.    Ju-ae probably won't be able to study abroad, as Kim did, because she is now a public figure and there are stricter international sanctions in place.    “For the time being, she will still be in training,” said Cheong. “She likely wouldn’t be able to properly aid her father until she turns around 20 years old and will likely continue to watch and learn by his side.

2022 highlights of K-Pop: From rise of new female groups to long-awaited...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000242359?sid=104,"Mon, 26 Dec 2022 16:38:00 +0900","K-pop girl group IVE (Starship Entertainment)Addictive rhythms and powerful choreography continued to propel K-pop up the global music charts in 2022.Korean artists have reached the top spot on the Billboard 200 -- the ranking of the best-performing albums and EPs in the US -- a record four times this year.Stray Kids was the first Korean act to top the chart this year with its album “Oddinary,” followed by Blackpink, (G)I-idle, and RM.Apart from the global chart-toppers, this year’s K-pop scene was undoubtedly dominated by the fourth generation girl groups such as NewJeans, IVE, (G)I-idle, Le Sserafim and Aespa.In addition, the return of groups such as Big Bang, Girls' Generation and Kara after several years of hiatus brought new energy to the industry.Here is a list of 20 tracks that best capture 2022.1. “Pink Venom” - BlackpinkBlackpink nabbed their first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with their latest full-length album “Born Pink” in early October, making them the first K-pop girl group to take the throne.“Pink Venom” is the first single from the album, and infuses the group’s trademark hip-hop style with the sound of the Korean traditional instrument geomungo.The single peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart for two weeks.The song ends with a chaotic rhythm as the beat drops.2. “Maniac” - Stray KidsStray Kids’ popularity grew by leaps and bounds with “Maniac,” the focus track from the EP “Oddinary,” which ranked No. 1 on the Billboard 200.The EP also sold over 1 million copies, a first for both the band and its label JYP Entertainment.Stray Kids said they tried to show their unique explosive power in a restrained manner for the song, but the track still carries Stray Kids' trademark noisy backing and a killer hook.3. “Hello” - Treasure“Hello,” the lead track from Treasure’s second EP “The Second Step: Chapter Two,” is filled with a positive and energetic message that reflects the cheerful image of the group.The dance song delivers cheerful vibes, with a bright mood overlaid with Treasure’s warm vocal color.Their label YG Entertainment’s characteristics pop out strongly in the chanted chorus with hip-hop elements.This is the group's first song without Bang Yedam and Mashiho, members who withdrew from the group a month after the release of “Hello.”4. “Hype Boy” - NewJeansNewJeans, the first girl group from the Ador label under K-pop powerhouse Hybe, made an impressive debut this year with their songs topping local charts.The rookie group’s second single “Hype Boy” came with four different music videos.The mid-tempo melodies and repetitive lyrics lead up to a catchy chorus, but what really made their track go viral was their refreshing and easy-to-follow dance, with choreography that looked back to the earliest generations of K-pop.5. “Love Dive” - IVEAnother rookie girl group, IVE, has cemented its position in the K-pop scene with its second single, “Love Dive.”The song is appealing and charismatic as it expresses the courage it takes to “dive into love” but what the girls really fall in love with is themselves.The motif of this was the story of Narcissus, the figure from Greek mythology who was so impossibly handsome that he fell in love with his own image reflected from a lake.The lyrics “Narcissistic, my god I love it” forms the hook of the song echoing like chants.6. “INVU” - TaeyeonThe title track of the soloist Taeyeon’s third LP “INVU” is a pop-house tune. A synth harmony is overlaid with a melody that combines with the singer's high-pitched vocals makes the storytelling more dramatic.The lyrics say that the singer knows she will get hurt and tired of loving the people, but she will continue to love others nonetheless.That is why she says “I envy you,” since others will stop loving her and abandon her, but she cannot do the same.From beginning to end, it contains changes in emotions and personal maturity under an organic and dense musical design.7. “_WORLD” - Seventeen“_WORLD,” from the album “Sector 17,” is an R&B song with a funky rhythm and a sweet melody.The song invites listeners into a “new world” with horn instrumentals, light disco influences, and soft and smooth vocals accentuating the “fresh teen” image that has represented Seventeen since its debut.The highlight of the tune comes with Vernon’s rap, opening with the lines, “Knock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door / Run your fingertips over the whipped cream cloud.”The light, flowy, and amicable song glides through the ears, definitely making it a pleasant track to listen to.8. “Tomboy” - (G)I-dle(G)I-dle comes back for ‘vengeance’ after a yearlong hiatus with its megahit song “Tomboy,” a rebellious pop-rock song with an ear-catching melody and eye-catching choreography.In the song, the girls refuse to become the “blonde Barbie doll” they say men want them to be and instead choose to be tomboys.The hook, which combines the members’ unique voices with a rough instrumental sound, and the addictive variation that flows out at the moment the atmosphere is heightened are the points to look out for.9. “Wild Flower” - RMBTS’ RM made a stunning debut as a solo artist with his album “Indigo” and the main track “Wild Flower” this year.RM sings of wanting to live not like a firework but a wildflower, highlighting the artist’s fear of losing his love for music.“Wild Flower” is composed of string instruments including a subtle guitar and percussion.Vocalist Youjeen from the band Cherry Filter adds volume to the song by adding her powerful delivery to the explosive chorus.“Wild Flower” reached No. 83 on the Billboard Hot 100.10. “Dreamers” - Jung KookThis year’s World Cup became more memorable for South Koreans thanks to “Dreamers” by BTS’ Jung Kook, adding to the national team's success in make it to the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.“Dreamers,” part of the Qatar World Cup's Official Soundtrack, featured Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi.The track speaks of how people make dreams come true through self-determination and perseverance: “Look who we are, we are the dreamers, We make it happen, ’cause we believe it.""The song debuted on Spotify’s Daily Viral Song chart in all 73 countries making Jung Kook and Japanese singer Fujii Kaze the only Asian musicians to achieve the milestone.11. “Good Boy Gone Bad” - TXTThis is a hip-hop track infused with a rock sound by Tomorrow X Together, also known as TXT.The group dressed head-to-toe in black outfits for the music video, which depicts an innocent boy engulfed in anger and loss after a breakup.Lyrics like “I’m like a zombie dead alive/ Born atop the tomb of love” exemplify the gothic atmosphere of the song along with the explosive and unyielding chorus.“Good Boy Gone Bad” has served to shift TXT’s image from lively and youthful boys to mature grownup men.12. “Polaroid Love” - EnhypenThis is a go-to tune if you are looking for a cute and heartwarming song.The chords used to compose the song are addictive and the melody is easy to sing along to.The song is about boys recalling the initial tingling moments of love while looking at a Polaroid photo.A “Polaroid Love” challenge on TikTok hit more than 1 million views as the song gained popularity in the country and abroad.13. “Antifragile” - Le SserafimAnother rookie girl group, Le Sserafim, surprised their fans by coming back with the vigorous choreography of “Antifragile.”The song starts off in minimalist style, with just a vocal and a drum beat, to make it sound sophisticated and unique.The melody is very addictive with few variations repeating the word “antifragile” and with a Moombahton undertone.The rap verses of the group’s members Eunchae and Chaewon “Walk like a majestic lion, Eyes glinting with so much Desire, Pour more gasoline on the fire” is the only transition of melody found in the song.14. “Girls” - AespaThis dance song with boisterous vocals and remarkable rapping over powerful bass and rough textured synths.“Girls” shows off the SM performance-style with a rugged dance breakdown, powerful climactic vocals and a chant for the chorus.With a rock guitar, “Girls” has a bombastic flair that gives a kick to the song, while the music video connects it to Kwangya, a storyline that develops in the SM cinematic universe.15. “Still Life” - Big BangSecond-generation K-pop idol group Big Bang made the most anticipated comeback this year with “Still Life.”“Still Life” is a soft-rock track that portrays the group’s history from the early 2000s when the band began their career up until now.The song is unlike Big Bang's typical party anthems, but G-Dragon’s whimsical lyricism, T.O.P’s husky raps, and Taeyang and Daesung’s unique vocals were enough to rally old fans.“Still Life” seemed to be a farewell message to the group’s old days and left fans wondering if it hints at a fresh start.16. “Forever 1” - Girls’ GenerationGirls’ Generation reunited for a summer comeback to mark its 15th anniversary with their seventh full-length album “Forever 1.”The title track “Forever 1,” made up of euphoric electro highs and soaring vocals, illustrates the K-pop veterans' everlasting love for their fans.The uplifting song brings back old memories of their debut single “Into The New World,” as both of them were produced by Kenzie.The music video of “Forever 1” shows where the members have been in terms of solo careers only to get back together as Girls’ Generation at the end.17. “When I Move” - KaraThe second-generation K-pop girl group made a stunning comeback at the 2022 Mama Awards, performing “When I Move” from their new special album “Move Again.”The track is composed of groovy guitar and synth bass that accentuates the retro touch in the song.Despite a seven-year hiatus from performing as a full unit, the members of Kara sang and danced in perfect harmony as if they had been performing beside one another all these years.For the new album “Move Again,” which marks Kara’s 15th anniversary, the group welcomed back Nicole and Ji-young, who left in 2014.18. “Yet to Come” - BTSThe K-pop megastars of BTS wrapped up the first nine years of their career with this lead single.Deviating from the vivacious dance tunes the band had recently led with, “Yet to Come” had a softer and more poignant tune, with the notes pleasantly knocking on the ears -- similar to those of “Spring Day” and “Life Goes On.”While the soft alternative hip-hop tune may feel bland to those who expected more of the band’s dance-pop hits such as “Dynamite” and “Butter,” it plays more like background music as the act reminisces on its journey, and as it braces for the next chapter of its musical odyssey.19. “Event Horizon” - YounhaSinger-songwriter Younha topped local music charts with this song which was a late-bloomer.“Event Horizon” was released in March but garnered popularity over half a year after when Younha started performing the track live on college campuses during the fall festival season.The song made a ""perfect all-kill"" by the end of November on local music charts including MelOn, Genie, YouTube Music, Flo, Vibe and Bugs.The modern rock sound blended well with Younha’s sentimental vocals.20. “Beatbox”- NCT DreamThis single is similar to the act’s former hits, with NCT Dream’s unique music style and sound combined with a hint of 1990s hip-hop.The tune unveiled in May served as a perfect way to cool off from the summer heat with beatbox-inspired dance beats that deliver a positive message to teenagers to make their voices heard if there is a dream they want to achieve.“Beatbox” is centered around cute, retro beats with chants that create a positive and energetic mood."

""Anyone who designs furniture or lamps, that person has a Korean style simply because they are Korean. We don`t need to find the Arirang line or the ""taegukki"" symbol, we do not need any stereotypical motif,"" Kim explained.Aglobal design festival based on the theme of ""Light into Life,"" the Gwangju Design Biennale 2005 was held at Kim Dae-jung Convention Center.Interaction and communication with the audience was present in most of the work and the crowds were mostly in their mid-20s. Even children had fun with art and video projections and their natural innocence gave a new dimension to the exhibition.Art was not reserved to the elite, but limited by the gallery space which became a playground where everyone was invited to play or watch how how design naturally evolves in our daily life.Every corner, art display or wall was covered with graffiti which served as a backdrop for souvenir photo sessions using mostly digital cameras or the latest trend in Korea - camera phones.It seems that one purpose of visitors was to get good self-portrait shots with as many backgrounds and artwork as possible.It`s almost as if the young generation is so image conscious that the line between reality and digital image has become blurry and some people seem only to exist through the representation of themselves, losing their real identity.“I am naturally shy and discreet in public but I feel important and myself when I take snap pictures or self-portraits in artistic surroundings,"" explained Hwang Eun-kyung, 24, carrying a digital Sony camera and taking photos of virtually everything at the Seoul Design Festival. ""It feels like I`m watching the world through a lens and changing it the way I want to see it.

[CELEB] STAYC breaks away from 'teen fresh' image with latest EP,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000026754?sid=106,"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 15:37:00 +0900","   STAYC poses during a showcase event for its new EP ""We Need Love"" on Tuesday at Yes24 Live Hall in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul. [HIGH UP ENTERTAINMENT]     If Korea were to make its own version of a coming-of-age teen comedy film like “Clueless” (1995) or “Mean Girls” (2004), it would be reasonable to base it on STAYC.    The girl group has maintained a concept that is reminiscent of Y2K fashion, along with music and choreography that so easily steals the hearts of teenagers these days with songs like “So Bad” (2020), “ASAP” (2021), “Stereotype” (2021) and “RUN2U” (2022).    STAYC, which stands for “Star to a Young Culture,” returned with new EP “We Need Love” on Tuesday, five months after its last EP “Young-Luv.com” (2022). However, unlike past songs, the group said that it aims to “break away” from its “teen fresh” genre, a name coined by fans which refers to STAYC’s usual style and image.    STAYC performed “Beautiful Monster,” the lead track, during a showcase event a few hours before its release at the Yes24 Live Hall in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul.       A concept photo for STAYC's ""We Need Love"" [HIGH UP ENTERTAINMENT]     The song is a bit more mature than STAYC’s previous songs, as the lyrics talk frankly about how one can feel scared about falling in love.    “It’s a pop dance track that likens someone who may be hurt but also healing to a ‘beautiful monster,’” Sumin said.    “While before, we focused on the beats for our songs, this time we went all in on the vocal aspects,” the group said. “We’re trying out something new and we look forward to what this album holds for us.”    “We Need Love” has three more songs — “I Like It,” “Love” and a remix version of “RUN2U.” While the entire EP is intended to explore various emotions love can elicit such as courage, hope and fear, the ultimate message of the EP is that “we need love.”    The six members, Sumin, Sieun, Isa, Seeun, Yoon and J, donned white outfits, with some also wearing crocheted knee-high socks and hats. The members explained that they chose white because it represents “beauty” and the glitter in their makeup or knitted accessories symbolized “a monster.”       A concept photo for STAYC's ""We Need Love"" [HIGH UP ENTERTAINMENT]     All of the songs were produced by Black Eyed Pilseung, or B.E.P., who is also the founder of STAYC’s agency High Up Entertainment. B.E.P. is comprised of duo producers Rado and Choi Kyu-sung. It is famous for producing an impressive amount of hit K-pop songs over the years, including Twice’s “Like Ooh-Ahh” (2015) and “Cheer Up” (2016), Sistar’s “Touch My Body” (2014), Chungha’s “Roller Coaster” (2018) and “Gotta Go” (2019) and Apink’s “Dumhdurum” (2020).    Because B.E.P. is considered a prominent producer in the K-pop scene, when it was announced in 2020 that High Up Entertainment had plans to debut its first girl group, anticipation was high.       A concept photo for STAYC's ""We Need Love"" [HIGH UP ENTERTAINMENT]     The group was created to emphasize ""healthiness"" with its music and has the goal of representing “teenage confidence.”     Choreography for songs like ""ASAP"" and ""Stereotype"" went viral on social media with people all over the world posting covers or taking in part of dance challenges.    STAYC has succeeded in establishing itself as a popular fourth-generation K-pop group. It was chosen as one of five notable artists of 2022 by Apple Music and Shazam and made NME's 100 Emerging Artists of 2022 in January.    The girl group is set to hold a fan meet on Aug. 13, at Sejong University’s Daeyang Hall in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul.       Sieun of STAYC [HIGH UP ENTERTAINMENT]       Sieun (Park Si-eun)     Date of birth: Aug. 1, 2001   Zodiac sign: Leo   Birthplace: Yongsan District, central Seoul   Debut: 2009 as a regular on SBS’s variety talk show “Star Junior Show Bungeoppang” (translated)   Agency: High Up Entertainment    Sieun has been in the spotlight ever since she was little, thanks to her father, singer Park Nam-jung, who was popular in the late 1980’s for his “L-dance.” Sieun, along with her father, appeared on numerous variety shows, starting with SBS’s “Star Junior Show Bungeoppang” (translated, 2009) and JTBC’s “Children, Life’s Greatest Blessing” (2013-16). She later launched her acting career as the lead in EBS’s drama series “Pluto Secret Society” (2014). Since then, she played minor roles as the child version of characters in shows like SBS’s “Six Flying Dragons” (2015), JTBC’s “Rain or Shine” (2017) and “Mystic Pop-up Bar” (2020).

"[PRNewswire] Meitu Releases the Anime Avatar Feature, a World First for",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0010540489?sid=104,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 18:04:00 +0900","			Al-Based Real-Time Avatars(XIAMEN, China, Dec. 21, 2018 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) Meitu, Inc., an AI-driven mobile internet company that has been transforming the way its users create and share their beauty, has officially launched the Anime Avatar feature on the Meitu App. The new feature not only automatically generates a highly personalized cartoon image, but also mirrors the user's facial expressions and movements in real time, distinguishing it from the avatar builders of yesterday. Catering to kawaii (cute) and cosplay culture enthusiasts, Anime Avatar is the world's first AI-based real-time anime avatar generator on a mainstream consumer app.The Anime Avatar feature can distinguish between tens of thousands of clothing and hair colors, thousands of facial features, hundreds of hair styles, twenty different kinds of accessories, and various skin colors and face types. All of this ensures that the resulting anime avatar both closely matches the attributes of real portraits and is a highly recognizable cartoon image.Users can select the ""Photo"" button to have the interface display both their original photo and the anime image. The feature allows users to customize their facial features, outfits, clothing items, hairstyles, accessories and backgrounds -- including for special occasions. This year will see the release of Christmas-themed costumes for the avatars and users will have even more custom themed options for future holidays, such as New Year, Spring Festival, and Valentine's Day.The Anime Avatar feature also allows users to create personalized videos and emojis. By selecting the ""Video"" button, users can record movements of up to 10 seconds, or further personalize the video by adding music and vocal recordings that can be customized by modifying their tone and pitch. By selecting ""Emoji"", users can capture unique facial expressions of up to 5 seconds in length that will be replicated by their anime avatar. They can also add stylized messages to further personalize their emoji.This feature comprehensively uses MTlab's AI technologies [http://mtlab.meitu.com/en/?lang=en ], including but not limited to: facial detection, facial landmark detection, facial attribute analysis, image segmentation, hairstyle recognition, clothing and accessory recognition, and image generation. Augmented Reality (AR) technology is also used to render the final product.- The facial landmark detection technology can locate 118 key points on the face and can analyze the face in real time with stability and accuracy in complex situations.    - The image segmentation technology can accurately segment the human body, skin, hair, and facial features and divide an image into a number of non-overlapping regions by analyzing contours, occlusion relationships, colors, textures, shapes, etc.    - The hair recognition technology identifies the basic attributes of human hair through a single portrait photo, including length, curl, bun, ponytail, bangs, volume, orientation, etc.    - The clothing recognition technology identifies the type of clothing, pattern, collar, sleeve length, and so on.    - The accessory recognition technology recognizes accessories such as glasses, hats, and jewelry.    - The image generation technology constructs a generation model, creates a conversion relationship between the real and desired images, and then outputs the anime-style effect.    - The AR technology enables real-time interaction between the real and virtual worlds through real-time modeling and rendering.The technological process works like this: users provide the initial data input for analysis by taking a photo or uploading an image. The AI technologies will then detect and analyze the image's attributes including but not limited to gender, age, facial and eye shape, eyebrows, skin color, facial expression, hairstyle, hair color, clothing, clothing color, accessories, and accessory colors. By using models to map and construct the relationship between the real and the anime images, an anime image with a remarkable likeness to the original is created. The AR technology then allows the avatar to mirror the user's facial expressions and movements in real time.An AI-driven company, Meitu has integrated these technologies into its suite of beautification apps across the board: the facial landmark detection technology is used as a basic technology in almost all Meitu products, laying the foundation for fine beautifying and exquisite virtual makeup effects. Facial attribute analysis is used to provide users with personalized beauty-enhancement features, virtual makeup effects, and beauty product recommendations. Image segmentation technology has a number of uses such as background replacement and blurring. Image generation technology has been applied to many functions such as AI Portrait and Andy the ArtBot. AR technology has been applied to virtual makeup and AR filters like Marvel's Venom-themed AR effect [https://corp.meitu.com/en/news/news/99.html ], which was recently released.Enhancing the image rendering accuracy to an even greater extent, Animie Avatar is an extension of Andy the ArtBot and Hand-Drawn Selfies, Meitu's highly successful AI-driven functions that also generate real-time illustrations based on users' real-life photos. In January 2017, Meitu launched its Hand-Drawn Selfie Function, turning users' portrait photos into unique illustrations. In November 2017, Meitu launched Andy the ArtBot, an upgraded version of the hand-painted selfie function. The Meitu App took the top spot in the App Store Rankings of six countries earlier this year, including Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Mongolia: much of this success can be directly attributed to Andy the ArtBot.About Meitu Inc.

Korea Lags Behind in AI Technology,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/023/0003756051?sid=104,"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 12:02:00 +0900","Korea did not report a single significant development in machine learning last year, according to a report ranking artificial intelligence technology around the world.In the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's AI Index published Monday, the U.S. ranked first last year in terms of machine learning development with 16 instances, followed by the U.K. (eight), China (three) and Canada and Germany (two each). France, India, Israel, Russia and Singapore also succeeded in more than one case of machine learning development.Korea achieved none even though Naver, Kakao, SK Telecom, KT and many other companies are spending huge sums of money to develop AI technologies.Korea's private sector invested US$3.1 billion in AI last year, the sixth highest amount in the world. Although that was just 1/15 of the amount spent by the U.S. over the same period, it was similar to India and Israel, which ranked fourth with $3.2 billion.But Korea has few newly invested companies in the field. Only 22 AI companies landed private-sector investment last year, putting Korea in 13th place, compared to 542 in the U.S., 160 in China, 73 in Israel, 57 in India, 36 in Singapore and 31 in Japan.""Despite the AI hype, investments centered mostly on large conglomerates and a handful of start-ups, which means there's no diverse ecosystem being created,"" an industry insider said.The study shows that Korea has been painfully slow to invest in AI technology. Cumulative investments from 2013 to 2022 stood at just $5.5 billion, and more than half of that came last year. Korean companies only rushed to develop generative AI like Chat GPT and image generation last year, when mass media interest in such technologies grew.Not a single AI-related law was passed in Korea last year. But the report finds that public interest in AI is relatively high among Koreans, who believe AI products and services have more benefits than drawbacks, making them the ninth most enthusiastic people in the world.China ranked at the top when it comes to public enthusiasm.The institute announces the AI Index every year and the data is used by the global industry as a snapshot of the latest trends. "
Korea’s webtoon industry sets sight on generative AI for dramatic growt...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0005099584?sid=104,"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 10:47:00 +0900"," Webtoon images created through the Onoma’s AI platform Tootoon engine [Photo provided by Onoma AI]The webtoon industry is taking a keen interest in the generative artificial intelligence technology as it could attract more creators to webtoon platforms and bring dramatic growth to the market  should it become more accessible to potential artists.Domestic startups in the Korean webtoon market, world’s biggest, have been making various attempts to use AI and are expected to expedite the birth of AI artists.Contrary to the existing AI technology that learns data and patterns to understand the target, generative AI creates new outputs through comparative learning from existing data. Image generation, a subfield of generative AI, can generate and color unlimited images on demand. This means you can be a professional webtoon artist without a special talent for drawing only if you have intriguing materials and stories. In other words, you can create a story using ChatGPT and make it into a webtoon using an AI image generator.According to the information technology industry on Thursday, Onoma AI, a Korean generative AI startup, will release a piece jointly created by a human webtoon writer and AI on major platforms as early as the end of this month. AI has played a significant part in creating the webtoon based on a human writer’s storyline, such as storyboard jobs, sketching and coloring, which were performed on Onoma’s AI platform Tootoon.“We will usher in a way that allows anyone to become a creator using AI technology,” said Song Min, chief executive officer and founder of Onoma. “We plan to shortly develop and release a technology that creates texts using ChatGPT and converts them into short-form videos through the Tootoon engine.”Tootoon creates webtoon characters, clothes, background images and storyboards according to written commands and will be open to the public free of charge in the middle of this month. If a user, for example, types in “several students leaving a classroom,” a cartoon image that matches the description will be generated and the webtoon can be completed once lines are added. Kakao’s image creation model Karlo [Images source: B^ DISCOVER]Making descriptions more specific will help AI generate more detailed images. AI also instantly creates webtoon backgrounds, which takes hours for writers to complete. There are no copyright infringement issues as all images created this way are intellectual property rights of Onoma, the company said.Onoma AI has earlier released Iconoci platform for free, which creates images using an AI model that has learned 400 million images and trained with 1 million icon data.Webtoon and animation industries are quickly adapting to the latest change. Famous cartoonist Lee Hyun-se has started developing his own AI technology, first of its kind for an active cartoonist. He will make AI learn 4,174 cartoons he has created for 44 years. The industry expects to see his new creation generated by AI as early as in the second half of this year.The Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) is also developing Deeptoon, an automated webtoon creation technology, with the goal for a release in 2024. A human artist will be engaged in plot development and sketching, and AI will handle the rest.Naver Corp. and Kakao Corp. are also accelerating their moves to join the trend. Naver Webtoon Corp. introduced the Webtoon AI Painter system in 2021 and has set up a Webtoon AI division to respond to the changes.Kakao plans to create an AI startup ecosystem by creating a fund worth at least 10 billion won ($7.6 million). The company will actively share Kakao’s image creation model Karlo and has distributed B^ DISCOVER, Korea’s first AI image generator application, free of charge since October last year. It also released on Tuesday the open beta version of B^ EDIT, a web service using Karlo to translate imagination into an image.Still, copyright infringement issues related to data used to train AI remain unresolved. Visual media company Getty Images last month sued AI company Stability AI Inc. for using its photos without permission or compensation."
Decoding Lee Jae-yong's fandom,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000240098?sid=104,"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 15:44:00 +0900","South Korea's most powerful businessman builds fandom on his way to chairman postSamsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong (fourth from left) poses for a photo with employees at Samsung SDS headquarters in Seoul in August. (Samsung Electronics)Taking selfies with rank-and-file employees and lining up for a lunch queue for a simple meal instead of a juicy steak is something that many didn't expect to see from Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, the most powerful business tycoon in South Korea.The 54-year-old third-generation chaebol scion has long lived a life away from the public eye, except in the past five years, when he made frequent headlines over his involvement in a high-profile bribery scandal. But as he gets closer to taking over his late father’s chairman post, he seems to be exhibiting a different image of a business tycoon from generations before him, which in turn has created a unique fanbase.On Instagram, the fan account jaeyong3831 documents every one of Lee's public appearances, including a sweet father-daughter moment at a chaebol wedding and a portrait of him drawn by an unknown user. The account has 148,000 followers as of September, and is filled with comments praising Lee‘s humility and rooting for his success in his incoming role as the chairman of Samsung Electronics -- a company that many Koreans feel attached to.""I support you anytime, anywhere in any circumstances ... just for being who you are,"" wrote one follower. ""I am so proud to have a businessman like you in our country. I pray for your happiness,"" commented another.Lee is trying to build a direct connection to the younger generation, a move experts note is inevitable given the current rapid generational shift in the corporate world.Lee’s father Lee Kun-hee was a charismatic leader who turned Samsung into a global technology powerhouse, while his grandfather Lee Byung-chul spearheaded the ""Miracle on the Han River"" with the principle of patriotic industrial service for the formerly poverty-stricken nation.In eyes of the public today, Lee Jae-yong is seen as a ""humble"" business leader who bears the heavy burden of leading the future of Korea’s beloved electronic giant.""Chaebol entrepreneurs have often hidden behind a curtain and spoken in an authoritative tone, sometimes in a rude manner. So a chaebol leader portrayed by the media as having a down-to-earth personality distances him or her from the conventional image of chaebol leaders,"" said Kwon Sang-jib, business professor at Hansung University.Lee is not the only chaebol heir seeking to connect with younger Koreans.Energy-to-chip giant SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and retailer Shinsegae Group Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin have been active on social media, sharing their private moments and thoughts on their accounts.""Chaebols in the past had less of a chance to communicate with the public due to bad preconceptions of them, and now seems to be the moment when chaebols happen to be breaking away from their collectively tarnished reputations,"" said Lim Myung-ho, a psychology professor of Dankook University.Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong (second from left) is seen picking up food at a cafeteria in Dos Bocas Harbor, where Samsung Engineering's refinery plant construction site is located, during his visit to Mexico on Sept. 10. (Samsung Electronics)Price to pay for being born with a silver spoonThird- or fourth-generation heirs who assume ownership of a chaebol have often been slammed for taking their inherited privilege for granted.When chaebol families first came to power in the 1960s, the public largely acknowledged that they helped foster the growth of the national economy. Young chaebol heirs were often faced with people doubting whether they deserved their positions.Lee was once one such figure, and has paid a hefty cost for his trials and errors. Lee has long been haunted by the collapse in the value of tech venture companies he controlled in the early 2000s in the wake of the ""dot-com bubble.""Under the so-called e-Samsung project, Lee in 2000 was tasked with managing more than a dozen fledgling tech companies including e-Samsung. He was responsible for starting their business with Samsung Group affiliates, only to have incurred losses in a year of operation that Samsung affiliates including Samsung SDS had to shoulder by overpaying for the companies' shares owned by Lee. Samsung officials involved in the activities were accused of a breach of trust but were not indicted.Following a series of controversies, twists and turns surrounding the path to inheritance from his father, Lee extended an apology to the public in 2020. He pledged to put an end to dynastic rule at Samsung by not passing the tech giant on to his children.This came amid a strenuous legal battle over Samsung's financial support of former President Park Geun-hye's close confidante’s equestrian daughter. In January 2021, this resulted in Lee's bribery conviction. Lee was released from prison in August the same year, but was restricted from reentering the Samsung boardroom. A year later, the restriction was lifted following a presidential pardon by incumbent President Yoon Suk-yeol.""Lee has suffered a series of ordeals, and that seems to be what makes him self-effacing,"" said Kang Hye-ryun, professor of business administration at Ewha Womans University.""Although Lee is to succeed the nation's leading conglomerate, he does not show off and keeps a low profile with a sense of humility, out of respect for what the public has been critical about.”Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong (right) poses for a photo with local employees at its Panama City office. (Samsung Electronics)Regardless of whether the making of Lee's public image was part of an intentional strategy, the company already appears to be taking advantage of his growing fandom as he seeks to return to the boardroom, two years after his father's death.Lee's public appearance in major Samsung locations at home and abroad -- including at chip plants, construction sites and offices -- have become more frequent, raising speculations that he might soon be promoted to chairman as early as November, in time for Samsung Electronics' 53rd anniversary.These publicity stunts can offset the former image of chaebol, once considered a hotbed of corruption and unfair business practices, among other scandals. Lee was not immune to these past controversies, but members of the public – especially the younger ones -- are now more likely to sympathize with the powerful figure with a soft personality.""Not many young people in Korea are aware of Lee's past projects like e-Samsung. That was when Lee was rather a hermit-like figure,"" Kwon of Hansung University noted.""The public's affinity with Lee does not mean the public has already forgiven Lee's failures in the past. Tolerance will come when Lee sets up a new blueprint based on his recognition of his past trials and errors.""Although Lee's fresh public image indicates a decent start to the succession plan, this should not be where it ends, another expert noted.""It is crucial for Lee's down-to-earth discussions with employees to trigger a change in corporate culture, so that open communication in the workplace can be normalized,” said Oh Il-seon, director of the Korea CXO Institute.""Samsung puts openness and flexibility at the forefront of its business, but there are doubts about whether the driver for corporate change is as strong as it was in the past.""(consnow@heraldcorp.com)"
Samsung Electronics plans $222 million chip test facility in Japan: repo...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0005130096?sid=104,"Mon, 15 May 2023 11:36:00 +0900"," [Photo by MK DB]South Korea’s tech giant Samsung Electronics Co. will build a new chip development facility in an apparent bid to reorganize its global supply chain.Japan’s Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei) reported on Sunday that Samsung Electronics will invest about 300 million yen ($222 million) in Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo, to build a new development facility for a production line for a prototype of a next-generation chip device, with the goal of starting operations in 2025. Industry insiders predict that the new line will likely produce prototypes related to post-processing for semiconductors and image sensors for vehicles.With this new chip development facility in Yokohama, the tech giant seems to be taking steps to fully operate its recently launched Device Solutions-related research and development center in Yokohama, dubbed DSRJ. In particular, this investment by the company seems to be designed not only to capitalize on Japan’s materials and parts competitiveness but also to contain the expansion of its rival, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), in Japan. Samsung Electronics’ DS Division is in charge of semiconductor and display businesses.TSMC, the world’s largest foundry or contract chipmaking company, is building a chip factory in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, with the goal of starting operations at the end of 2024, and recently announced plans to build a second Kumamoto plant. The products produced here are expected to be supplied to Japan. TSMC is also building an R&D center in Ibaraki Prefecture.The Japanese newspaper also focused its report on the fact that TSMC, the world’s No. 1 player in terms of semiconductor sales, and Samsung Electronics, the No. 2 player, will both set up R&D bases in Japan.Japan’s future market potential also seems to be an important factor for Samsung Electronics’ decision as there are many companies in Japan that need chips for autonomous vehicles, which the tech giant is focusing on as a future growth engine. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. logo [Courtesy of TSMC]Sony Group Corp. and Honda Motor Co. established a joint venture automotive company, Sony Honda Mobility Inc., to develop autonomous cars. The fact that Kyung Kye hyun, head of Samsung Electronics Device Solutions Division, visited Sony headquarters in Tokyo in November and Sony Chairman Kenichiro Yoshida reciprocated by visiting Samsung Electronics’ Pyeongtaek Campus in March can be seen as part of efforts for the two companies to cooperate to secure dominant positions for the future market.During their recent two rounds of summit talks, the Korean and Japanese leaders agreed to establish supply chains for chips through cooperation between Japanese materials, parts and equipment companies and Korean manufacturers of chip equipment. In this regard, analysts watch carefully whether the Japanese government will offer subsidies to Samsung Electronics. The Nikkei report predicted that the Korean company could receive about 10 billion yen from the Japanese government for this R&D investment.The Japanese government earlier provided TSMC with about 476 billion yen, which is half of the company’s facility investment for the Kumamoto plant, and 19 billion yen, about half of its project cost to build its semiconductor R&D center in Ibaraki Prefecture.The Japanese government also plans to provide about 330 billion yen to Rapidus Corp., a semiconductor manufacturer established last year with the support of eight major Japanese companies, including Toyota Motor Corp., Kioxia, Sony, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT), and SoftBank Group Corp.In addition, the Japanese government will offer financial support to Kioxia building a NAND flash memory plant in Iwate Prefecture with Western Digital Corp., a U.S. computer drive manufacturer and data storage company, and U.S. semiconductor producer Micron Technology Inc.’s plan to expand a DRAM plant in Hiroshima.Samsung Electronics Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee recently met with Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk in the U.S. to discuss ways to cooperate in future high-tech industries, including semiconductors for autonomous vehicles, according to the company. The meeting was held during Musk’s visit to Samsung Electronics’ semiconductor research center in Silicon Valley on May 10, along with his executives, Samsung said.These series of developments can be seen as reflecting Lee’s future strategy to secure a dominant position for the next-generation semiconductor market."
[REVIEW] ChatGPT comes up with obvious answers to questions about life,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035580?sid=101,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 11:31:00 +0900","  The first book ever in Korea to be written by ChatGPT, titled ""45 Ways to Find a Purpose in Life"" was released in local bookstores on Feb. 22. [SNOWFOX BOOKS]     ""45 Ways to Find a Purpose in Life"" is the first book written by ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by U.S.-based OpenAI, to ever be published in Korea.     Not only is it written by a chatbot, but it's translated by Naver's Papago, a translating service based on artificial intelligence.    The book cover is also “designed” by Shutterstock AI, an AI image generation platform launched by Shutterstock in collaboration with OpenAI in January. Literally from its front cover to its back, the entire book was created by AI-based services.     Consisting of six chapters, the book's genre, as its title suggests, is self-help. It attempts to tell its readers something about finding their life purposes — although its content cannot be more mundane or eye-rolling-ly obvious. The book talks about forming relationships, finding value and happiness and controlling your emotions for the betterment of your life.    ""Life is a journey full of twists and turns, with no clear destination in sight,"" reads the chatbot-authored book.     ""Often, we find ourselves lost and searching for purpose and meaning in our lives. The good news is that there are many paths to discover our purpose, and it's never too late to start.""    The title of the book and its content was chosen by Seo Jin, the CEO of domestic book publisher Snowfox Books.    The intent of the book arose purely from Seo’s curiosity about whether AI could write something which could persuade and leave an impact on people’s lives.      Although each of the ""45 ways"" were chosen by a person, the chatbot added comments about honesty, prejudices and emotions.     ""Saying 'I don't know' when we don't have the answer is a powerful form of honesty and vulnerability,"" the book reads. ""The obliviousness gives room for improvement and growth.""     The chatbot defines prejudices as ""an unfortunate reality in our world, and it can be a major obstacle to finding purpose and meaning in life.""    ChatGPT encourages readers to speak out against the prejudice and discrimination we witness.     Its stance about emotions is also interesting. It writes that emotions ""can often cloud our judgment and lead us astray, making it difficult to make clear and rational decisions."" It says it's important to find the right ""balance"" between logic and emotions.      The process of creating the illustrations on the book's cover and for each of its chapters was completed by Shutterstock AI in about three hours. Seo first ordered an image based on the book’s title, but the AI failed to decipher her intentions and produced hundreds of random images. She added the book’s subtitles and table of content to request and then the AI produced three to four images from which she chose the cover readers see now: A picture of a person walking on a curved path against the background of a river, mountains, clouds, the sun and a bird.    It took just two people and 38 hours for ChatGPT to write this book.    In total, it took exactly a week for the book to be organized, written, translated, printed and published, a stark comparison to the months of writing, discussing, revising and proofreading it takes to publish a standard book.      The book consists of 297 pages and contains both the English and translated Korean text. Seo intentionally put them side by side for viewers to see for themselves the work of AI-based translation.    In the beginning of the book, it is stated that the person who proofread the content is no expert in English. The person read through the book to fix minor errors or delete text that was not necessary.    The translation is near flawless and to the point. There may be some awkward expressions here and there but readers will have no difficulty comprehending what the chatbot is saying.    The entire book can be summarized into a handful of sentences: Recognize that humans are limited beings. Admit to the fact that we are fallible, vulnerable and moral, which is why it is important to find balance in everything you do — whether that be a relationship, work, goals, or values. Happiness is about learning to be grateful, focusing on the present and practicing self-care.    While these musings are rather obvious, ""45 Ways to Find a Purpose in Life"" is a testament to how far machine intelligence has come.     While the amount of time and effort it took to produce this book is certainly impressive, the product is proof that the perplexity of thinking, persuasion and empathy still lies in the realm of humans. We are not “infallible,” as the chatbot says, but in some ways, neither is the chatbot.  "
Competition gets heated among Korean tech giants for supersized AI power,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0004894727?sid=004,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:16:00 +0900"," Korean tech companies Naver, Kakao and telco majors contest to market supersized artificial intelligence with machine learning adaptability as close as possible to human brain and speech capabilities.Naver said in its virtual Naver Cloud Summit on Wednesday that it will reveal a web-based beta version of 'Clova Studio' at the end of this month to allow startups and SMEs to use its super-sized language model HyperClova. Naver’s AI HyperClova model unveiled in May features 204 billion parameters. Higher parameters lead to a model's increased capacity. Naver, which has applied the platform to its own search, shopping, care call, minute creation services, expects the combination HyperClova and data from each user to bring AI innovation for high return on investment.  Sources say Naver recently completed performance validation of HyperClova in sentence creation and summarization and dialog. The company is developing a multilingual AI model that can speak Korean, English, and Japanese like a native speaker, a multi-modal AI that can comprehensively understand and convert different types of data such as text, image, video and voice, and an 'Avatar chatbot' that can understand and express emotions with a specific character. Naver also introduced SuperPODm a new supercomputer from Nvidia, and it is considering additional investments in computing infrastructure to increase the size and sophisticate its AI models.The move is interpreted as a response to LG Group and other rivals. LG Group recently unveiled its super-sized AI platform called EXAONE for which it plans to double the number of parameters from the current 300 billion to 600 billion next year, featuring about three times more parameters than HyperClova.SK Telecom is on its way to open source its next-generation AI language model 'GLM' optimized for Korean in partnership with the National Institute of the Korean Language. The company expects that the opening of GLM will be applied to various services such as emotional conversation, problem solving, writing, translation, and coding.Kakao recently joined the race for super-sized AI by unveiling a new model that can draw a picture beyond human-like writing. Its subsidiary Kakao Brain on Wednesday unveiled its super-sized AI multi-modal 'minDALL-E' on github, the world's largest open-source community. It has been just a month since the release of its Korean-specific AI language model 'KoGPT' last month. The image generation model creates a desired image in real time when a user inputs a text command. It learned a bundle of 14 million texts and images. As the model understands the command context and draws an image directly, it can be applied to content creation, such as making illustrations or producing educational materials. Kakao Brain is also upgrading KoGPT performance by increasing its model parameters by 5 times from 6 billion to 30 billion.KT Corp. another major telco, recently formed a joint team to speed up the development of super-sized AI. KT plans to finish learning its AI model with 200 billion parameters by the end of this year and launch a commercial version in the first half of next year with an aim of applying it to its AI speaker GiGA Genie and AI contact center.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]		"
[The Fountain] Schumpeter’s moment? Be alerted. (KOR),https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035161?sid=004,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 16:14:00 +0900","PARK SU-RYEON The author is head of the IT industry news department at the JoongAng Ilbo.     Not even blockchain or metaverse got this much attention. We’ve heard enough praise for ChatGPT’s brilliance, concerns over the possibility of humans being overtaken by artificial intelligence (AI), and model answers that proper use of AI is important. Nevertheless, we cannot take our eyes off the breathless movements of AI companies.  As hundreds of millions of people around the world anticipate and fear AI, now may be the Schumpeter’s moment — the moment of “creative destruction” where old things die out and qualitative changes are made within the social structure. Economist Joseph Schumpeter considered entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship to be leaders of these dynamic changes as key drivers of capitalism. Through the eyes of Schumpeter, my attention went to the “competitive ecosystem” which became the basis of ChatGPT.  Start-up company OpenAI provoked the race between Google and Microsoft. Its founder Sam Altman explained why he boldly introduced the interactive AI which Google and other companies had kept disclosed, citing “accountability.” In an interview with Forbes on Feb. 3, Altman said, “I really believe we need society to get a feel for this, to wrestle with it, to see the benefits, to understand the downsides. So I think the most important thing we do is to put these things out there so the world can start to understand what’s coming.”  In society as a whole, open competition enhances the efficiency of resources. Even before ChatGPT, OpenAI aimed for such efficiency by disclosing voice recognition technology or image generation AI technology as open source. As companies working on AI technology services rode on the accomplishments of OpenAI, related markets were created. Many companies already pay to use the previous ChatGPT model. It also offers a paid product for $20 a month.  I am not yet certain whether this movement will evolve into expansion of productivity on the entire Earth or creative destruction for greater individual freedom. There are concerns that it could end up being a party only for Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists and big techs.  According to PitchBook, a venture capital research firm, 78 AI start-ups attracted $1.37 billion last year. It is likely that information and technology will be more concentrated in Silicon Valley.

AI 기술 서비스를 궁리하던 기업들이 오픈AI의 성과에 올라타면서 기술 확산의 속도가 빨라졌고, 관련 시장이 생겨났다. 챗GPT 이전 모델을 유료로 사서 쓰는 기업들이 이미 여럿이다. 월 20달러짜리 챗GPT 유료 상품도 나왔다. 이런 생성형 AI들에서 최적의 산출물을 뽑아낼 명령어(프롬프트)를 사고파는 중개거래 사이트도 있다.    이런 움직임이 지구 전체의 생산성 확대로, 개인의 자유를 더 키우는 창조적 파괴로 발전할 것인지 아직은 모르겠다. 구글이 순식간에 ‘낡은 기업’이 돼버린 것 같지만, 그거야 구글 사정이고. 실리콘밸리의 벤처자본과 빅테크끼리의 경쟁, 그들끼리의 파티가 될 우려에서다. 벤처캐티털 조사업체 피치북에 따르면, 지난해 미국 내 생성AI 스타트업 78곳에 13억7000억 달러가 몰렸다고 한다. 정보와 기술이 실리콘밸리로 더 집중될 가능성이 크다.    얼마 전 한국 대통령이 챗GPT에게 연설문을 써보게 했더니 잘 쓰더라며, 공무원들에게 업무 효율을 높이는 데 쓰도록 검토하라고 했다고 한다. 여야 의원들도 앞다퉈 챗GPT를 얘기한다. 신기하고 놀라운 마음이야 알겠지만, 지금이 슘페터 모먼트라면 참 아쉬운 메시지들이다. 혁신 경쟁을 촉진할 환경을 어떻게 조성할지 이 정부에서 누군가는 구상하고 있기를 바란다.

[The Fountain] Schumpeter’s moment? Be alerted.,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035146?sid=110,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:00:00 +0900","PARK SU-RYEON The author is head of the IT industry news department at the JoongAng Ilbo.     Not even blockchain or metaverse got this much attention. We’ve heard enough praise for ChatGPT’s brilliance, concerns over the possibility of humans being overtaken by artificial intelligence (AI), and model answers that proper use of AI is important. Nevertheless, we cannot take our eyes off the breathless movements of AI companies.  As hundreds of millions of people around the world anticipate and fear AI, now may be the Schumpeter’s moment — the moment of “creative destruction” where old things die out and qualitative changes are made within the social structure. Economist Joseph Schumpeter considered entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship to be leaders of these dynamic changes as key drivers of capitalism. Through the eyes of Schumpeter, my attention went to the “competitive ecosystem” which became the basis of ChatGPT.  Start-up company OpenAI provoked the race between Google and Microsoft. Its founder Sam Altman explained why he boldly introduced the interactive AI which Google and other companies had kept disclosed, citing “accountability.” In an interview with Forbes on Feb. 3, Altman said, “I really believe we need society to get a feel for this, to wrestle with it, to see the benefits, to understand the downsides. So I think the most important thing we do is to put these things out there so the world can start to understand what’s coming.”  In society as a whole, open competition enhances the efficiency of resources. Even before ChatGPT, OpenAI aimed for such efficiency by disclosing voice recognition technology or image generation AI technology as open source. As companies working on AI technology services rode on the accomplishments of OpenAI, related markets were created. Many companies already pay to use the previous ChatGPT model. It also offers a paid product for $20 a month.  I am not yet certain whether this movement will evolve into expansion of productivity on the entire Earth or creative destruction for greater individual freedom. There are concerns that it could end up being a party only for Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists and big techs.  According to PitchBook, a venture capital research firm, 78 AI start-ups attracted $1.37 billion last year. It is likely that information and technology will be more concentrated in Silicon Valley.  Recently, President Yoon Suk Yeol had ChatGPT write a speech and was satisfied that it was well-written. He told civil servants to consider using ChatGPT to enhance work efficiency. Governing and opposition party members also talk about ChatGPT.  It is understandable that they are amused and surprised, but if now is the Schumpeter’s moment, we have a long way to go. I hope someone in this government is planning to create an environment that will facilitate competition in innovation.  "

Meta to lure advertisers with new AI technology,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000038521?sid=105,"Wed, 17 May 2023 17:32:00 +0900","  Meta Korea's director Kim Jin-ah speaks at a press event to introduce Meta's services on artificial intelligence at its office in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Wednesday. [META KOREA]     Meta hopes to lure back advertisers with its latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology by helping them make the best Facebook and Instagram Reels to appeal to its 3 billion daily user base.    The tech giant introduced its new AI technology, named AI Sandbox, which will be released by the latter half of this year. The service is currently in the stage of beta testing. The service provides generative AI-powered ad tools for marketers to reach out to its reels-friendly consumers.      Currently three tools are offered on the service: text variation, in which a marketer types in text description about its product and the service offers multiple text explanations that is more catchy and understandable to consumers; background generation, in which a marketer describes advertisement background in text and AI generates equipped background images; image outcropping allows marketers to adapt their horizontal advertisements on vertical videos using the AI service without making additional adjustments.    Based on the first quarter of this year, Meta’s monthly active users on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp was 3.8 billion, and daily users on the apps was 3 billion. For reels, 2 billion clips are being shared everyday among users. The tech company saw a drop in annual advertising revenue for the first time last year, falling 1 percent on year to $113.6 billion due to the tech winter that has swept around the world.      “The number of reels shared daily has doubled compared to six months ago,” said Meta Korea’s director Kim Jin-ah at a press event in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Wednesday. “Korean users follow the trend as more users peruse reels as their content — not only for entertainment, but it also offers marketing values for businesses.”    Reels definitely helps businesses attract potential customers, argues Meta.    Sixty-four percent of 120,000 users followed a company’s profile after watching its reels, according to a recent survey conducted by the company. Sixty-one percent purchased a service or a product from a company after watching its reels. The survey reported a 20 percent jump in sales for a company if it uses reels in their marketing campaign.    “Reels have transcended the realm of content to become a language of its own,” said Park Ki-young, head of creative shop department. “Any business will be able to form a close bond with their consumers if they make their reels with the purpose of giving entertainment, contain relatable elements and be easily comprehensible.”    Other open-source AI models created by Meta were also introduced during Wednesday's session, including “LLaMA,” which offers text paraphrase or simplification, solve mathematical questions and answer reading comprehension questions, and “Imagebind,” another generative AI service which can recognize relationships between six modalities such as video, audio and text without human supervision to create desirable outputs.    “Humans have progressed using tools,” said Choi Young, head of vertical, e-commerce and retail at Meta Korea. “In digital marketing, AI is substituting roles to set up campaigns. The role of humans now lies in asking the right questions to achieve adequate results.

For instance, when users type in requests such as “draw a picture in a Salvador Dali style” or “create an image using a full moon and the Eiffel Tower,” the AI model presents such images.Unlike a search engine that simply finds already existing images on the web, the AI model is capable of understanding the context of the users’ requests and creating a whole new image, the company said. Prior to the launch, the AI model has undergone a machine learning process with 14 million sets of text and images.“Since minDALL-E mimics the art styles of popular artists, rather than replicating the artwork itself, there is no problem of copyright infringement,” a Kakao Brain official said.With the AI model, users can easily generate illustrations for storytelling content or to make educational materials.“If we join hands with KakaoTalk, users might even be able to self-create their own emoticons,” the official said.Kakao Brain has recently upgraded its first Korean-language AI model KoGPT as well. Using the deep learning supercomputer to carry out calculations with larger data sets, it has enhanced the model’s accuracy to better understand Korean, the official said.On Friday, Kakao Brain will hold an online miniconference to share their insights on KoGPT and minDALL-E.“We are researching the components required for an AI to think and speak like a human being. Also, we ask ourselves how an AI that has memory and deduction skills could communicate like us,” said Kim Il-du, CEO of Kakao Brain.“Starting with the two AI models, we plan to unveil other supergiant AI models as open source to further contribute to the development of the country’s IT industry and the next generation of deep learning,” Kim added.

French photographer and street artist brings his work to Seoul — legall...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000038506?sid=103,"Wed, 17 May 2023 15:18:00 +0900","  ""Migrants, Mayra, Picnic across the Border, Tecate, Mexico-U.S.A"" (2017) [JR]     He may have had a simple start to his street art career after finding a camera on a subway in Paris, but now he tours the globe, covering the grounds of the Louvre Museum or literally holding a gigantic feast across the border between the United States and Mexico.    This is the story of French photographer and street artist JR, whose pseudonym is short for his first name, Jean-René.      French photographer and street artist JR during a press preview at the Lotte Museum of Art earlier this month for his first Korean solo exhibition, ""Chronicles."" [SHIN MIN-HEE]     The aforementioned two works made headlines several years ago — after all, it’s not every day that one sees thousands of strips of paper glued onto the grounds surrounding the Louvre’s glass pyramid that magically turn into a massive optical illusion, or take part in a large shared meal that crosses both sides of the Mexican border’s fence.    For the past 20 years, JR’s works have made their homes on the streets, with the artist pasting large-scale portraits or collages of people he's met onto the walls of buildings. He is now holding his first Korean solo exhibition, titled “Chronicles,” at the Lotte Museum of Art in Songpa District, southern Seoul.    “I don’t see this as a retrospective, but as an exhibition that oversees a few of the projects that connect people and bring community together,” he said.    Because his works tend to be larger than life, JR had heaps of stories to tell about them. During a press preview earlier this month, instead of a curator, he himself eagerly explained the background information for nearly all 140 pieces on view at the museum.      ""JR at the Louvre Museum & The secret of the Great Pyramid, Anamorphosis in the morning"" (2019) [SHIN MIN-HEE]     JR recalled how many of his initial projects brought him problems with the law.    “My practice was very illegal,” the 40-year-old artist told press. “I didn’t ask for any permit at that time. I would just take over the street and exhibited my photography this way.”    He was sued for posting black-and-white photographs as part of his “Portrait of a Generation” project in 2004 all over the Montfermeil suburbs of Paris. Among them, “Portrait of a Generation, Braquage, Ladj Ly” questions how the media can be biased in representing people of color through a depiction of French film director Ladj Ly holding up a camera like a gun.    “At the time, the mayor sued me for pasting on the buildings, but he could never find me because my identity was JR — the initials — and a year later the photos were still on the wall,” JR said. “There were very large riots in France that started in that neighborhood in front of my portraits, so that image was on the cover of the New York Times and so that’s how my work was first discovered overseas by the media.”    His “Face 2 Face” (2006-07) project was also held illegally. It featured giant portraits of Israelis and Palestinians of various occupations standing face-to-face on the dividing wall of the two nation’s borders across more than eight cities.      “Portrait of a Generation, Braquage, Ladj Ly” (2004) [JR]     He said that he does not necessarily try to “work illegally,” and that he usually tries to get permits from city officials when doing public projects.    In his “Chronicles” project, which started in Clichy-Montfermeil in 2017 and continued on to San Francisco and New York in 2018, he started collaging thousands of photos of individuals that all have a unique story to tell into a single frame. JR recorded each person’s story in their own voice and they are accessible though the free “JR:murals” app available on all mobile devices.    For “The Gun Chronicles: A Story of America” (2018), JR worked with TIME magazine and met with “a wide and complex spectrum” of people to share their differing opinions and experiences on firearms in the United States.      “The Gun Chronicles: A Story of America” (2018) [JR]     Megan Boland is a corporate executive from Virginia who is clearly visible in the photograph among 244 others, holding up a sign written with “Gun Rights = Women’s Rights!!!”    “I became a proponent of firearms when my husband was away on a business trip and someone tried to break into our house 10 years ago,” she says in her recording. “I went from being anti-gun to pro-gun in seconds.”    “You can click on every single person [through the app] and hear their point of view,” JR said. “Now, I couldn’t have those people in the same room because they do not agree with each other. So here you have a surgeon who is picking bullets out of bodies every day, you have the people from the Black Lives Matter and Black Guns Matter movement, you have White Supremacists. It represents the spectrum of society and why they are for or against gun control.”    To JR, documenting how his works came to life is essential when displaying them in an exhibition or even on his website. He says that it’s not the image that matters most, but the story behind each piece.      ""The Wrinkles of the City, La Havana, Rafael Lorenzo y Obdulia Manzano"" (2017) [JR]     “I’ve always documented [the process of my works],” JR said, “and so from my very beginning I really captured that so it could be exhibited in the best way to tell the story of how art has actually impacted people. That’s actually to me the most important part.”    The exhibition includes JR’s latest optical illusion piece on the Han River, titled “Untitled, Anamorphosis, Seoul” (2023). He noted that “the energy of the city is pretty intimidating at first” but that he aims to discover the layers to Seoul by communicating with the locals.    “Chronicles” continues until Aug. 6. The Lotte Museum of Art is open every day from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tickets are 20,000 won ($15) for adults.  "
Revisiting the acting career of Lee Jung-jae,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000239957?sid=104,"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 12:18:00 +0900","From rebellious 'Young Man' to pitiful Gi-hun in ‘Squid Game,’ Korean star shows how an actor grows, matures in rolesLee Jung-jae (Yonhap)“I’m not going home until I make it big.”Just as Lee Jung-jae said through the words of Lee Han, the character in his first-ever movie gig, “The Young Man” in 1994, the now internationally acclaimed actor returned home Sunday after becoming the first Asian ever to win for best actor in a drama series at the Primetime Emmy Award last week.A day after his win, it was confirmed that Lee’s big-screen debut will be rereleased in local theaters on Sept. 29, offering fans a peak at the early days of the “Squid Game” star.Lee Jung-jae is seen on the poster for “The Young Man.” He was 21 years old. (Studio Bonanza)The rerelease is not a mere attempt to cash in on Lee’s recent success, but is meant to commemorate the 40th anniversary of “The Young Man” director Bae Chang-ho’s debut. In an interview with local media, Bae reminisced on how he felt Lee epitomized the image of Generation X in Korea, as a free-spirited, ambitious young man not afraid of what other people thought of him.Lee’s performance in the flick won him recognition for best new actor at major film award shows, including Korea’s most prestigious Grand Bell Awards and Blue Dragon Film Awards. But his reputation as a thespian with a strong presence was not won overnight, with critics often viewing him as just another pretty face on the screen.Pretty face on quest to prove worthWhile Lee made a name for himself with his screen debut in 1994's hit TV drama “Feelings,” it was his subsequent appearance in a supporting role in 1995 drama “Sandglass” that earned him nationwide fame. His portrayal as a solemn bodyguard was a sensational hit, and there were floods of petitions to urge broadcaster SBS not to kill off his character.As Lee later admitted in interviews, his character trait as a man of few words was a directorial decision to mask his poor acting skills. The 22-year-old was baffled by the influx of accolades at the time, which he felt was not well earned.Lee Jung-jae (right) in ""Sandglass"" (SBS)“I was cast as a fashion model while working at a coffee shop, then I shot a chocolate commercial, and got a gig in ‘Sandglass’ and ‘The Young Man.’ All this happened within a year and I was confused,” he said later in an interview in 2013, marking his career spanning 20 years. “I didn’t know how to act but I had work to do, so I made so many mistakes. It was embarrassing and stressful, so I decided to enlist to the military.”Still confused as to how he was able to win so many awards, Lee served his mandatory duties as noncombatant military personnel. Despite his personal doubts, Lee continued his winning streak with the critically acclaimed “City of the Rising Sun,” for which he won best actor at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and the Korean Association of Film Critics’ Awards.He also became lifelong friends with co-star Jung Woo-sung, who would go on to work with him on several projects in the decades to come.What followed, however, was nearly a decadelong slump in his television career, coupled with middling successes on the silver screen that were few and far between. After the success of “Squid Game,” Lee admitted in interviews that there had been times when he felt cornered, struggling between financial problems and a lack of good scripts.Impressive acting, impressive filmography The 2010s marked a turning point for Lee’s career, starting with his appearance in 2010 thriller “The Housemaid.” In the film directed by Im Sang-soo, Lee played the authoritative patriarch, leaving an impression on the audience while playing opposite the internationally acclaimed Jeon Do-yeon and Yoon Yeo-jeong.Lee went continued his winning streak with heist film “The Thieves"" in 2012, featuring an ensemble cast consisting of big names like Kim Yoon-seok, Kim Hye-soo, Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo-hyun. It became the most financially successful Korean film at the time. It still remains No. 6 on the all-time Korean box office list.“The Thieves” director Choi Dong-hoon and co-star Jun would reunite with Lee in another smash hit film, “Assassination"" in 2015. The period piece portrayed the fictional assassination attempt on Japanese military leaders during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonization of Korea.Lee played another man caught between two worlds just two years earlier in crime-thriller “New World"" in 2013, where he portrayed an undercover cop having an identity crisis while his yearslong infiltration of the biggest corporate crime syndicate in the country. Despite sharing screen time with Choi Min-sik and Hwang Jung-min, considered among the most accomplished male actors in Korea, Lee’s performance was widely praised and his presence left a lasting impression on the audience.Lee Jung-jae in “The Face Reader” (Showbox)Lee Jung-jae in “The Face Reader” (Showbox)Lee shined in another period piece that opened the same year, opposite Song Kang-ho -- the eventual winner of the best actor award at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival -- in “The Face Reader"" in 2013 as the ambitious Prince Suyang, who overthrows his nephew, King Danjong, to ascend as king in the Joseon era.His first appearance in the flick occurs after over an hour of buildup about the treacherous prince, and is considered one of the most memorable entrances in Korean film. Marked by the bloody corpse of an animal he had just hunted, his scarred, menacing face appears with the monologue of the titular face reader on how Suyang has the face of a traitor.In 2017 and 2018, Lee played a minor but memorable role as the charismatic king of the underworld in the popular “Along With the Gods” trilogy, and played the menacing hit man in 2020’s “Deliver Us From Evil,” winning actor of the year at the local Asia Artist Awards.‘Squid Game’ and beyondDespite his series of home runs on the big screen, Lee did not really have major success on TV, save a moderate hit as the lead for “The Aide: People Make the World Go Round” on JTBC in 2019. While Lee’s career as a film actor took him to new heights in the 2010s, the aforementioned series was the only TV show that he appeared on in the decade.That was, of course, before his unprecedented international success as the lead of “Squid Game” in 2021. He plays a debt-ridden man down on his luck who partakes in a precarious, deadly game in the show on Netflix, which was highly praised for its social satire and memorable characters, quickly becoming the platform’s most watched show ever.Lee Jung-jae (right) in ""Squid Game"" (Netflix)The show boosted Lee to international stardom, making him the first Korean to win for outstanding performance by a male lead actor in a drama series at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, outstanding lead actor in a drama series for Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globes nomination.Lee’s global fame also landed him the lead role for the upcoming Disney+ series “Star Wars: The Acolyte,” although information about his character or the release date has not yet been released. What has been confirmed, of course, is Lee’s return as the lead for the second season of “Squid Game,” currently slated for 2024.At 49 years of age, the Korean movie star is now shooting for a new realm. At the Cannes Film Festival in March, Lee made his directorial debut with the espionage thriller “Hunt,” co-starring with his close friend Jung Woo-sung as rival agents in the Korean intelligence agency during the 1980s.Lee Jung-jae (left) and Jung Woo-sung star in “Hunt.” (Megabox JoongAng PlusM)The film received mostly favorable reviews following its Aug. 10 release in Korea, and is now the sixth highest grossing film of the year here.In a post-Emmys celebratory press conference for the cast of “Squid Game” on Friday, Lee said his biggest joy was that Korean content is being shared and beloved by the international audience.“Through writing the script for ‘Hunt’ and directing it, I also am beginning to meet with the international audience with Korean content in hand. Such meeting should occur more often in the future,” he said. “I think (we) need to think about how to introduce (to the world) more Korean movies and Korean dramas.”"
Samsung Brings Advanced Ultra-Fine Pixel Technologies to New Mobile Imag...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002109655?sid=105,"Thu, 02 Sep 2021 13:19:00 +0900","- The ISOCELL HP1 offers industry-first 200MP resolution based on 0.64 µm-pixels and new pixel-binning technology, ChameleonCell  - The ISOCELL GN5 is a super-slim 1.0µm 50MP sensor with elevated autofocusing   Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, September 2, 2021- Samsung Electronics today introduced the ISOCELL HP1, the industry’s first 200-megapixel (MP) image sensor with 0.64μm pixels, and the ISOCELL GN5, the first image sensor to adopt all-directional focusing Dual Pixel Pro technology with two photodiodes in a single 1.0μm pixel.   “Samsung has been pioneering ultrafine pixel technologies that are taking high-resolution image sensors to the next level,” said Duckhyun Chang, executive vice president of sensor business at Samsung Electronics. “With the ISOCELL HP1 that is breaking barriers and the ISOCELL GN5 bringing ultrafast auto focus, Samsung will continue to lead the trend for next-generation mobile imaging technologies.”   The ISOCELL HP1 is the industry’s first mobile image sensor to support 200MP. Based on Samsung’s most advanced 0.64μm-sized pixels, the ISOCELL HP1 brings such ultrahigh resolution in a small package that fits comfortably in today’s handheld devices. With the ISOCELL HP1, pictures hold an astonishing amount of detail that helps the image stay sharp even when cropped or resized.    For ultimate low-light photography, the ISOCELL HP1 features an all-new ChameleonCell technology, a pixel-binning technology that uses a two-by-two, four-by-four or full pixel layout depending on the environment. In a low-lit environment, the HP1 transforms into a 12.5MP image sensor with large 2.56μm pixels by merging 16 neighboring pixels. The newly formed 2.56μm pixel is capable of more light absorption and sensitivity, producing brighter and clearer photos in in-doors or in the evening. In bright outdoor environments, the sensor’s 200-million pixels can capture ultra-high-definition photography on mobile devices.   The ISOCELL HP1 can take 8K videos at 30 frames-per-second (fps) with minimum loss in the field of view. The HP1 merges four neighboring pixels to bring the resolution down to 50MP or 8,192 x 6,144 to take 8K (7,680 x 4,320) videos without the need to crop or scale down the full image resolution.    The ISOCELL GN5 is the industry’s first 1.0μm image sensor to integrate Dual Pixel Pro, an all-directional autofocusing technology that can substantially boost autofocusing capabilities. This technology places two photodiodes, the smallest in the industry, within each 1.0μm pixel of the sensor either horizontally or vertically to recognize pattern changes in all directions. With one million phase-detecting multi-directional photodiodes covering all areas of the sensor, the ISOCELL GN5’s autofocusing becomes instantaneous, enabling sharper images in either bright or low-lit environments.    The image sensor also makes use of Samsung’s proprietary pixel technology, which applies Front Deep Trench Isolation (FDTI) on a Dual Pixel product for the first time in the industry. Despite the microscopic photodiode size, FDTI enables each photodiode to absorb and hold more light information, improving the photodiodes’ full-well capacity (FWC) and decreasing crosstalk within the pixel.    Samples of Samsung ISOCELL HP1 and GN5 are currently available.		"

[Test Drive] Hyundai Sonata gets sporty upgrade,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000246188?sid=104,"Sun, 14 May 2023 15:37:00 +0900","N Brand performance lineup added for first time for longest-running family sedanSonata the Edge N Brand with 2.5 gasoline turbo engine (Hyundai Motor Group)The face-lifted version of Hyundai’s flagship family sedan Sonata the Edge has made a grand comeback after four years, making its 37th anniversary this year.The Sonata is the longest-running car in South Korea, selling around 9.3 million units since its launch in 1985. But the beloved midsized sedan suffered a setback in recent years as more drivers flock to SUVs. Amid slowing sales, the car even faced rumors that it might be discontinued when the carmaker delayed launching the eighth-generation model last year.Dispelling rumors, the new Sonata has returned with a complete turnaround both in style and performance. The car, in particular, added its first N Brand performance model in an apparent move to shed a boring family car image and appeal to younger drivers with racing car elements.The rear part of Sonata the Edge N Brand with 2.5 gasoline turbo engine (Byun Hye-jin/The Korea Herald)The most noticeable change was how the car’s front part adopted Hyundai’s new signature seamless horizon lamp, so-called unibrow design, succeeding a refreshed family look of new Hyundai cars, including the Grandeur sedan and the Kona compact SUV.A test drive was conducted last week from Hanam to Gapyeong in Gyeonggi Province, which was a roundtrip course of some 100 kilometers. The reporter drove two versions – the N Brand version with a 2.5-liter gasoline turbo engine and a 1.6-liter gasoline turbo engine model.The N version, in particular, delivered high-speed stability and maximum cornering capabilities, a refreshing surprise for many drivers who are familiar with existing Sonata cars as a comfortable family sedan. Compared to the N model, the 1.6-liter model felt more suited for city commuters.The interior of Sonata the Edge N Brand with 2.5 gasoline turbo engine (Byun Hye-jin/The Korea Herald)As for the interior, the N Brand model took after the signature red stitches and N logos of the performance line on car seats. Both models offered spacious legroom and trunk for a midsized sedan. The controversial button gear in the former eighth generation model was replaced with a column gear shift on the right side of the steering wheel.A total of eight types of powertrains are available for the new Sonata, including three for the N Brand version. The basic price ranges from 28 million won to 39 million won ($21,000-$29,000). Among its key rivals is the Kia K5 sedan with a 2-liter gasoline engine. For the same engine models, the Sonata is about priced 8.05 million higher."
Samsung Introduced the Industry’s Smallest 0.64μm-pixel Mobile Image S...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002104861?sid=105,"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:28:00 +0900","- Samsung’s most versatile image sensor offers 50Mp options for both front and rear-facing cameras   Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, June 10, 2021- Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today introduced the industry’s first 0.64-micrometer (μm)-pixel image sensor, the 50-megapixel (Mp) Samsung ISOCELL JN1. Equipped with the latest pixel technologies such as enhanced ISOCELL 2.0, Smart-ISO and Double Super PDAF, the JN1 can capture more vivid images on the industry’s smallest 50Mp mobile sensor.   “Samsung’s advanced pixel technologies have once again pushed boundaries with the utmost precision to develop an image sensor with the industry’s smallest pixel size, yet with powerful performance. The new ISOCELL JN1 at 0.64μm will be able to equip tomorrow’s sleekest smartphones with ultra-high resolution mobile photographs,” said Duckhyun Chang, executive vice president of the sensor business at Samsung Electronics. “As we drive our commitment to innovation in pixel technologies, we will continue to bring a wide range of mobile image sensor offerings to the market.”   A new addition to Samsung’s high-resolution image sensor lineup, the JN1 employs ISOCELL 2.0 technology with added enhancements that improve light sensitivity by around 16-percent. For low-light environments, the sensor utilizes Samsung’s four-to-one pixel binning technology, Tetrapixel, which merges four adjacent 0.64μm-pixels into one big 1.28μm-pixel to quadruple light sensitivity for brighter 12.5Mp photographs.   With such advanced technologies all embedded in a small 1/2.76-inch optical format, the ISOCELL JN1 is the most versatile image sensor yet from Samsung. Through close collaboration with ecosystem partners, the JN1 is compatible with existing 1/2.8-inch products, allowing the sensor to be used for front-facing, ultra-wide or telephoto cameras, in addition to standard wide camera options. This means that users can take highly detailed selfies or group pictures in an amazing 50Mp resolution, as well as high-resolution video at up to 4K and high-zoom ratios. The smaller sensor can also reduce the height of the camera module by around 10-percent, minimizing the camera bulge for slimmer and more streamlined designs in next-generation smartphones.   For enhanced dynamic range, the ISOCELL JN1 comes with Smart-ISO, a technology that changes the conversion gain based on the environment’s illumination level. Smart-ISO uses Low ISO mode in bright settings to retain detail in the highlights, and High ISO in low-lit environments to reduce readout noise and generate excellent low-light performance. Using Smart-ISO, the JN1 also offers inter-scene HDR in mixed-light settings for optimum exposure levels derived from two separate readouts, from Low and High ISOs, that are merged to create a final image.    For faster auto-focus, the ISOCELL JN1 integrates improved Double Super PD. The previous Super PD technology used specially designed oval-shaped micro-lenses over two adjacent pixels arranged side by side to detect phases. Double Super PD features twice the density of pixels (1/16) used for phase detection than Super PD (1/32), enabling the same auto-focus performance even in environments with about 60-percent less illumination levels. For smooth crystal-clear videos, the image sensor supports up to 4K resolution video recording at 60 frames-per-second (fps) or full HD at 240fps.    The Samsung ISOCELL JN1 is currently in mass production.▶ 네이버에서 디지털데일리 채널 구독하기▶ IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드 [딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>		"
LG's AI fashion designer Tilda debuts in New York,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000234551?sid=104,"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 13:56:00 +0900","Fashion designer Park Youn-hee goes onstage with Tilda during a runway show at New York Fashion Week Tuesday. (LG Corp.)LG Group’s virtual fashion designer powered by the hyperscale artificial intelligence has debuted at New York Fashion Week, bringing the engine’s text-to-image generation capability to new heights, its holding company LG Corp. said Tuesday. The virtual fashion designer, named Tilda, has collaborated with Park Youn-hee, a South Korea-born fashion designer behind the Greedilous brand.The collection was unveiled during a Fall 2022 runway show Monday held at Spring Studios, a popular New York Fashion Week venue. The collection, dubbed “Greedilous by Tilda – Flowers on Venus,” featured some 200 items based on over 3,000 images and visual patterns that Tilda created -- a visual inspiration to Park’s clothing designs.When Park gives an instruction to Exaone, a hyperscale AI engine, it processes the language for Tilda. Images are then generated based on the processed texts and Park can then start designing clothes based on the images.Greedilous chief Park Youn-hee‘s designs, inspired by Tilda, took to the runway at New York Fashion Week on Monday. (LG Corp.)With Tilda, the runway show came “within just a month and a half of preparation,” as opposed to the usual months of work involving dozens of human designers needed to put together a collection, Park said in a statement. “I aspired to design clothes with all my soul by adding human emotion to Tilda‘s original creativity,” she said.Tilda is powered by Exaone, the AI language model first showcased in December. It is capable of processing 600 billion samples of text and 250 million high definition images. The multi-modality artificial intelligence allows Tilda to create a new image by itself, with its ability to explore beyond the language it perceived. The fashion event comes less than a year after LG AI Research, an in-house research hub dedicated to AI, announced a plan to develop a “creative hyperscale AI” that can work with a professional fashion designer. Pattern images created by Tilda (LG Corp.)LG Corp, a holding company of Korea’s fourth-largest conglomerate by assets, said Tilda became the first to come up with visual creations based on text processing powered by AI engine in a real-life use case.According to LG, Tilda will launch its own eco-friendly fashion brand after the New York Fashion Week Fall 2022, and continue to play a role of connecting people in the metaverse world.Tilda marks the first AI-driven variant of Exaone, which LG expects to apply in the field of manufacturing, research, education and finance, LG Corp. said. New York Fashion Week Fall 2022 runs from Friday to Wednesday, local time. (consnow@heraldcorp.com)		"
Generation Change Continues at PPP,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/023/0003624696?sid=104,"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 11:45:00 +0900","The conservative People Power Party continued its radical generation change at the top on Monday when it picked two party spokesmen in their 20s after a televised debate.Their selection follows the election last month of 36-year-old Lee Jun-seok as leader of the traditionally staid party made up of aging pillars of society.The decision to hold an open competition for spokespersons was part of the party's efforts to transform its fusty image and appeal to young voters who have grown disillusioned with the ruling Minjoo Party.The new spokesmen are Lim Seung-ho (27), a former deputy youth spokesman for the short-lived splinter Bareun Party who came first in the competition, and Yang Jun-woo (26), who is unemployed and came second.They beat more mainstream candidates like former TV presenter Kim Yeon-joo (55), and Shin In-kyu, a 35-year-old lawyer, who will serve as deputy spokespeople over the next six months.Since Lee's election last month, party membership has surged 2.7 times or by 38,000 people, and the bulk are younger metropolitan voters rather than elderly provincials.In May, the PPP already welcomed 14,000 new members. Among the new members in June, 19,800 were in their 20s to 40s, accounting for 52 percent, and 687 were even teenagers.Some 6,900 came from Seoul, 1,800 from Incheon and 10,000 from Gyeonggi Province. Another 787 came from South Jeolla Province, the traditional stronghold of the Minjoo Party.Kim Jae-seop, head of a district party chapter in northwestern Seoul, told the Chosun Ilbo, ""Even just a few months ago, we were able to recruit just one to two members a day if members went canvassing, but over the last couple of months, 10 people a day contacted me through Facebook wanting to join. I was surprised how many of them are university students or office workers in their 30s and 40s."""

After the process is finalized, the image is set to further improve in radiometric and geometric accuracy. Jamsil Sports Complex (The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport)Though the specification of the new satellite has similarities to other mid-sized practical satellites that South Korea has previously launched, the CAS500 is the first satellite developed by the country’s own technologies, according to the ministry.Over 98 percent of the technologies and components, including the optical payload, were developed within the country, it said, with the exception of the charge-coupled device.The observation satellite, which was developed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute with funding from the science and transport ministries, is also the 17th satellite Korea has launched to the space. Korea has deployed eight small satellites, five KOMPSAT satellites dubbed Arirang, and three GEO-KOMPSAT satellites known as Cheollian since the KITSAT-1 (Our Star) in 1992.The national land observation satellite was launched to scan the Korean peninsula from 497.8 kilometers above the surface, passing the location at 11 am local time during its daily orbit of the Earth. It will also be used for inspection of the national territory, survey of crop cultivation in farms, as well as gathering of raw data for map making and urban planning. It is expected to also boost the country‘s capacity for disaster response by providing an exclusive data source on natural disasters such as storms, heavy snow, floods, and wildfires.The satellite will also provide data for the digital twin platform and smart city -- two key areas in the current administration’s New Deal Program as well as contributing to advanced transportation, including autonomous vehicles and drones.By Yim Hyun-su (hyunsu@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
[Gordon Brown] The new global youth movement,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000199042?sid=004,"Thu, 05 Apr 2018 17:54:00 +0900","			The recent March for Our Lives in the United States inspired millions not just across America, but also around the world. Until the nationwide demonstrations on March 24, most people thought that little new could be added to the conversation about the seemingly endless rounds of gun killings.Yet the brave and moving way in which, out of their anguish and pain, young people told the world that decisions on gun laws and safe schools are too important to be left to adults who had let them down has reshaped the political landscape.It’s not just in America that a youth-led revolution is coming alive. Around the world, young people are becoming a power in their own right. Millions of young people are now engaged in what has become the civil-rights struggle of our time.In India, the Global March Against Child Labor has mobilized hundreds of thousands of young people, who have walked millions of miles demanding an end to child labor and the right to go to school.Likewise, in Bangladesh, starting in the remote Nilphamari district, thousands of girls have driven forward the “wedding busters” movement to create “child marriage-free zones.” Inspired by the Girls Not Brides movement, and at the risk of beatings and sometimes murder, schoolgirls have united to defy their own parents to prevent forced marriages. And, in Nigeria, the group Youth Advocates for Change marched through the capital Abuja in 2015 demanding safe schools and proper police and army protection against the terrorist extremists of Boko Haram.The picture is clear: we are in the midst of a fight for freedom that has gone global. It includes girls in India demonstrating against police inaction over sexual assaults; Pakistani schoolchildren marching through Lahore after the latest Taliban attack on schools; young people on the streets of Cameroon’s capital, Yaounde, supporting refugees; and Yemeni students demonstrating against a war that has destroyed hundreds of schools and left two million children with no education.The global youth uprising has intensified this year. In January, 40 million children and adults in India protested against child marriage by forming a human chain stretching more than 8,000 miles in Bihar state. In February, Peruvian students were fired upon in Lima as they demonstrated against what they called the “Youth Slave Law,” which would employ students as unpaid interns. And thousands of students have taken to the streets in Honduras and India to oppose the rising cost of higher education.These new movements reflect our current digital age, in which young people can increasingly connect with one another in their own countries and across borders. In doing so, they are exposing the gap between the promise of opportunity and the grim reality of unequal chances -- especially for girls, who comprise the majority of the 260 million children worldwide who are not in school, and the majority of the 400 million children who finish their education by the age of 11 or 12. Indeed, half the worlds’ children -- some 800 million -- finish school without any of the qualifications needed for the workforce of tomorrow. Many are condemned years before they reach the official school-leaving age to child labor, child marriage, or even to child trafficking.Young people’s new message of defiance and hope for real change echoes the compelling plea for environmental action by a 12-year-old girl, Severn Cullis-Suzuki, at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. It was Cullis-Suzuki who brought a low-key conference to its feet -- and started to bring a skeptical world to its senses -- when she said that the environment was too important a matter to be entrusted to adults. The older generation, having failed to deliver a sustainable environment, could not be permitted to ruin the chances and opportunities of the next generation.And an even more powerful message is coming from young people today: that their right to education is too important to be entrusted to the adults who have failed to deliver.Almost a century ago, Eglantyne Jebb, who founded Save the Children, said that the only language everybody could understand was the cry of a child. But the cries of children have all too often been swept aside, and even the most progressive among us have acted as if children are silent observers. If the enduring image from a century ago is one of helpless children, then the image remembered by the next generation will be radically different. In the next few days, young people in Pakistan, where seven million school-age children are denied the chance to attend school, will launch a petition demanding the right to education. Their plea will be backed at the G-20 Argentina Summit this November, when 700 Global Youth Ambassadors from 90 countries, mobilized through the Theirworld charity, call on world leaders to support a new International Finance Facility for Education -- a multi-billion fund dedicated to enabling all children to go to school.It is an important moment for those of us who were children of a 1960s cultural revolution that failed to fulfill its promise, and now find ourselves overtaken by new movements with far more global potential for good. The torch is not being passed to a new generation; this new generation has had to seize it. They deserve our support.Gordon BrownGordon Brown, former Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom, is United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education and Chair of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity.

Key to success in the K-pop industry: Is it the artist or the agency?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000037769?sid=103,"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:27:00 +0900","  Fifty Fifty performs its viral hit ""Cupid"" during a press conference held on April 13 at the Ilchi Art Hall in southern Seoul. [YONHAP]     As K-pop continues to expand its influence around the world, the Korea JoongAng Daily would like to introduce Celeb Confirmed, a new entertainment news and community service to deliver K-culture news to readers around the world. This two-part series will decipher the unique relationship between an agency and its artists to better understand the special dynamics that are driving the growing force.   Which comes first in K-pop, the idol or the agency?    With the rookie girl group Fifty Fifty receiving extra attention not only for becoming the fastest K-pop group to land on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with “Cupid,"" but also for the fact that it was grown by a small agency unbeknownst to many, the discussion is growing over who has the bigger say in making K-pop, K-pop.    To some, the conundrum is equally as deep and complex as the philosophical “the chicken or the egg” question, spanning the three-decade history of K-pop — an industry where the success of a group often matches the size of its agency.  Fifty Fifty, for example, only sold 1,500 copies of its debut EP “The Fifty” (2022) in the first week of its release despite the positive reviews it got from both fans and critics. Fifty Fifty is managed by Attrakt, an agency owned by StarCrew Ent, which manages only four singers as of 2023.    On the other hand, NMIXX recorded the highest debut album sales by a K-pop girl group with 227,399 copies of its single “Ad Mare” (2022) within just a week of its release, despite mixed reviews from the public. The band landed on the Billboard 200 albums chart with its latest EP “expérgo” but not on the Hot 100 chart, which is decidedly more difficult to enter.    In fact, JYP Entertainment released a “Blind Package” of NMIXX’s debut single in July 2021, months ahead of the group’s actual debut, and received 60,000 reservations within just 10 days.    JYP Entertainment released a “Blind Package” of NMIXX’s debut single in July 2021, months ahead of the group’s actual debut, and saw 60,000 copies of reservations without having revealed any information about the group. [JYP ENTERTAINMENT]      Girl group NMIXX performs its new music in a showcase held on March 20 at the Yes24 Live Hall music venue. [YONHAP]     By then, no information other than the fact that it will be a new girl group by JYP Entertainment had been revealed, but people still willingly spent money — all because they had faith in the label’s ability to put together a high-quality girl group.  The success of Fifty Fifty marked the beginning of a new generation of K-pop in which the conventional rules of the market — the bigger the agency, the higher the chance of a K-pop group being a success — are eroding due to the shifting media landscape. Smaller companies are finding ways to climb to the top while single artists are coming forward as individuals, breaking free of the agency nametags that always accompanied them in the past.  Contrary to American pop stars, or stars of any country even, for whom it’s common for people to be completely oblivious as to which agency they belong, a K-pop group never comes without the branding of its agency, especially if it’s from one of the larger companies — think Korea Exchange-listed companies like HYBE, SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, FNC Entertainment, Cube Entertainment and RBW, or agencies like Starship Entertainment or EDAM Entertainment, which are owned by tech giant Kakao.    This is so much the case that experts often compare K-pop to the world of automobiles, where names of cars are always accompanied by the names of their manufacturers, like Ford, Lamborghini, Mercedes-Benz or Hyundai, rather than by the model alone.      HYBE headquarters in Yongsan District, central Seoul [HYBE]      SM Entertainment headquarters in Seongsu-dong, eastern Seoul [SM ENTERTAINMENT]        The teacher, parent and agent   K-pop agencies wield a surprisingly dominant hold over their idols, because in Korea, they’re more than just agencies — they’re both the teacher and parent, and that makes them inseparable from their stars.    It starts with the huge amount of investment needed to make a group.    During the three, five or however many years it takes for an agency to train and roll out a band, agencies spend millions, if not billions, of won to take care of the teenagers so they can become ""idols,"" as the occupation is referred to in K-pop.    The so-called dorms that trainees live in are houses rented out by agencies, while the food they eat and the lessons they take for vocals and dance are also covered by the company. The cost of cosmetic procedures, not necessarily limited to but including plastic surgery, also take up a huge portion of the deal.    There is no exact data on the number of these prices, neither do agencies disclose the data publicly, but the ballpark figure of producing a girl group is said to be at least 300 million won ($224,000) per member. Girl group Loona, for instance, is said to have cost its agency 10 billion won to produce, including marketing and promotion.    SM Entertainment even opened up a K-pop training center named SM Universe in April last year, offering a three-year curriculum like a regular middle and high school, but teaches singing, dancing, modeling, acting and music composing to students who want to become stars.    The process is so extensive that students who enroll are required to drop out of their original schools and instead study for school equivalency credentials.      Boy band BTS receives an award for its ""Wings"" (2016) album at the 31st Golden Disc Awards in January 2017. [JOONGANG ILBO]      Girl group Blackpink receives the Rookie of the Year award at the 31st Golden Disc Awards in January 2017. [JOONGANG ILBO]     All seven members of K-pop’s biggest act, BTS, for example, trained under its agency, previously known as Big Hit Entertainment but now known as HYBE, for three years on average before their big debut in 2013. Members of girl group Blackpink trained for five years on average before their debut in 2016.    So when an idol debuts, the agency needs to start covering the already-spent expenses with the newly-generated revenue from its stars.    Contrary to Western pop stars, who oftentimes get picked up after they’ve fully proven their talents and thus require less dollars to nurture, Korean idols don’t get paid until they make up for the millions of won they burned through before actually debuting.    Idols frequently reminisce on years of not making any money until they’ve paid off all their “debt.”    Singer Yuju, a member of girl group GFriend, has said she got her first paycheck two years after her debut, while former Momoland member Yeonwoo said it took her three years to get paid. Monster rookie girl group NewJeans, on the other hand, got paid after just two months — a major indicator of success in K-pop.      Students practice their runway walking at SM Universe. [KIM KYUNG-ROK]     Essentially an incubator, it is hard to rule out the role of an agency in the success of a star, if not just financially, but also mentally. The sort of teacher-student relationship becomes normal among constituents, like how all SM Entertainment artists refer to founder and former chief producer Lee Soo-man as “Teacher Lee Soo-man.”    “In the very beginning of K-pop, the founders of major agencies themselves were celebrities — just take the names of the companies,” said music critic Park Joo-noo, referring to Lee Soo-man’s SM Entertainment, Park Jin-young’s JYP Entertainment and Yang Hyun-suk’s YG Entertainment. YG is short for Yang Goon, with goon in Korean meaning young mister.    “It was natural that companies started by revolving around these founders, especially because their names carried power and influence. That structure stuck, and although there have been definite risks and shortcomings, they had their perks, too,"" Park said.       Battling in a small arena   The catch is that agencies don’t ease their grip on idols after they debut. In fact, the tough micro-managing only intensifies, because the small domestic market requires extensive marketing and image-making to beat competition.    “A major difference also comes from the fact that the Korean music market wasn’t big enough for companies to depend on just sales from music, while those in bigger countries could,” music critic Cha Woo-jin said.    “The North American market is so large that companies can make a profit without having to put on extraordinary efforts to sell anything more than albums or concerts. But in Korea, album and concert ticket sales alone weren’t enough to make up for the investment that companies put in, which meant that agencies had to get involved a lot more to generate other means of cash flow.”    According to a report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the U.S. music market exceeded $10 billion for the first time in 2022, the largest in the world, as opposed to Korea’s market, which ranks sixth. Specific numbers were not given.    To make up for the limited consumer base, the agency takes the initiative to specifically target certain consumer groups and has their artists act out the strategies, rather than letting the artists focus on their music or carry out promotional events on their own.      Boy band BTS poses for photos ahead of a press conference held on May 29, 2017, for receiving the Top Social Artist award at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards. [YONHAP]     This means that in K-pop, the agency does it all: It produces and manages a group, publishes and markets the group’s music, promotes and markets the group and acts as their spokesperson, making it impossible to separate a star from its agency, especially very early on in that person’s career.    Stars are trained to convey a certain image on stage and continue that repertoire on other televised programs so that fans grow fond of the artist’s personality and spend money to get closer to them in any way.    Fan club memberships and tickets to meet and greet events are such examples.    Agencies offer special benefits to fan club members to encourage them to join, which again builds a sense of unity and encourages fans' affection. The chance for a slot in the “lucky draw” to a meet and greet is counted by the number of albums a person buys, rocketing the number of an album copy that fans would buy from one to over a hundred.    Albums also come with random photo cards of certain members, leading fans to buy more copies to get the cards of their favorite member.           So, the agency comes first?   No, and this is where the dilemma starts.    What sets K-pop apart from any other manufacturing business in the world is that the “products” are people — individual human beings with their own minds and creativity.    Even though it may be the agency that puts together the band and comes up with details related to how they’re first presented to the public, the rest depends much on how the individuals actually pull it off.    Stars who turn out to be much more talented and sincere in their music than first anticipated can lead to the success of an entire band and tons of dollars for its agency, again exemplified by BTS.      Executives of Big Hit Entertainment, now known as HYBE, pose for photos at the Korea Exchange (KRX) headquarters in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Oct. 15, 2020, the day the company went public on the KRX after seeing massive success with its boy band BTS. [JOONGANG ILBO]     There was a time when HYBE, back in its Big Hit Entertainment days, was also considered a small agency.    In fact, in 2010, before BTS started marking its presence on Billboard in 2016, Big Hit Entertainment had only 10 employees in the company, excluding trainees, and BTS needed to wait until Synnara Record closed at 8 p.m. so that it could meet with some 20 fans for a meet and greet session — all because they couldn’t afford to rent out a proper venue.    It was October 2017 when BTS’s “DNA” sat at No. 85 of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for the first time in its career. The rest is history: BTS topped the chart for the first time in September 2020 with “Dynamite,” then again in December with “Life Goes on,” followed by “Butter” and “Permission to Dance” in 2021.    BTS made so much money in the first half of 2020 that it took up 87.7 percent of Big Hit Entertainment’s revenue, helping the company acquire more companies and go public on the Korea Exchange on Oct. 15 that year. But two years later in 2022, the announcement of BTS ceasing group activities brought down HYBE’s stock prices by 25 percent the next day, a blow from which it took eight months to recover.    No matter how well an agency plans its moves, the only certainty is that nothing will go as planned — and that’s the beauty of the industry. It’s not a matter of what method is right or wrong, but the pros and cons of how each system functions, according to pop culture critic Jeong Deok-hyun.    “It’s truly a case of the chicken or the egg when discussing this issue in K-pop,” he said.    “No party can exist without the other, but, realistically, the agency’s power in all this is especially indispensable. The artists’ abilities are very important, but much can depend on how an agency unfolds that in the business perspective. The K-pop market was designed so that experts from all different fields come together to create a single result, and that’s just not possible by one individual.”      Zico of boy band Block B was hugely successful with his ""Any Song"" TikTok challenge in 2020. [SCREEN CAPTURE]      Fifty Fifty performs its viral hit ""Cupid"" during a press conference held on April 13 at the Ilchi Art Hall in southern Seoul. [NEWS1]        Eggs start hatching   A changing media environment brought yet another variant to the equation of a K-pop group’s success: online platforms.    Contrary to the past, when small companies struggled to land their bands on major television shows, meaning less coverage and exposure to the press, these bands can now go straight to the cyberworld and start their own YouTube series or TikTok challenges in the hopes that it will go viral.    Smaller companies still do inevitably mean smaller budgets for fancier shows, but short-form video services have reduced the need for major promotion costs.    Fifty Fifty’s “Cupid” is a prime example. A snippet of its sped-up English version, called the ""Twin Ver.,"" became a beloved audio source for TikTok challenges, even earning it the moniker “the best pre-chorus of 2023” and leading to the six-month-old quartet becoming the hottest act in town.      Rapper and producer Zico founded his own agency KOZ Entertainment in November 2018. [KOZ ENTERTAINMENT]     TikTok had also helped rapper and producer ZICO storm Korean music charts in 2020 with his “Any Song” (2020) challenge, leading to his self-founded agency KOZ Entertainment being acquired by HYBE in November that year. The agency plans to roll out a new boy band on May 30.    Artists are increasingly flaunting their talents as more than mere idols and taking more creative initiative with their work, while diversifying media outlets act as mini stages for them to flaunt their talent to the larger audience.    Each member of BTS, leader and producer of girl group (G)I-DLE, the 3RACHA producer unit of boy band Stray Kids, Seventeen, Pentagon — the list of artists creating their own music and work goes on and on.    “At the end of the day, it has to come down to the artist,” said music critic Cha.    “Take cars, for example: It’s the people at Ferrari that make Ferrari what it is today, not the brand itself. Music comes down to the people who make the music. Consumers want to see unique, attractive characters that have more to tell than just the one hit song. It’s the culture that forms around the song and the people, and that’s not something that can be made by a company.”    See more Korean entertainment stories  here on Celeb Confirmed.  "
"Naver carves out younger, international image under 40-something leaders...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0004880877?sid=004,"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 10:09:00 +0900"," South Korea’s top internet company Naver Corp. which sparked controversy for domineering work culture and approach towards smaller competitors and vendors will go under 40-something overseas-educated leadership for younger identity and sensitivity towards new business.Naver on Wednesday tapped Choi Soo-yeon in charge of global business as its new chief executive. Choi, 40, joined Naver in 2005 after studying civil & environmental engineering at Seoul National University. She also graduated from Yonsei University Law School and Harvard Law School and has been engaged in overseas business at Naver from 2019.Choi will replace current chief Han Seong-sook who will be leading ahead of her term expiry in March 2023 to explore Naver’s overseas expedition. Naver also appointed Kim Nam-sun responsible for investment and global M&A at Naver as its new chief financial officer. Kim, 43, is an M&A expert who also graduated Harvard Law School and has worked at U.S. law firms and investment firms Morgan Stanley and Macquarie Asset Management.Kim, also a Seoul National University graduate, was recruited in 2020 and ever since has been recognized for his outstanding performance in investment and legal affairs while overseeing Naver’s overseas investment and M&A matters. He led a taskforce team in charge of new growth engines at Naver. He was involved in Naver’s 600 billion won ($508.2 million) acquisition of North America’s largest webstory platform Wattpad, other major M&As at home and abroad, and other major equity investments.The unconventional reshuffle underscores Naver’s show of will to establish a dynamic and communicative workplace and enhance global business under new leadership with global mindset and expertise, the company said.The idea came from Naver Founder and Global Investment Officer Lee Hae-jin who had argued for younger leadership for global expansion.Both Choi and Kim will take on key role of excavating future businesses and targeting overseas market with new businesses in search, webtoon, shopping, and artificial intelligence sectors. Lee has called for the company to aggressively advance into overseas markets like the U.S., Europe, and Asia.

[Hallyu Power] The Barberettes bring retro back,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000173781?sid=004,"Tue, 07 Jun 2016 17:25:00 +0900","Promotional image of the female retro-pop musical trio The Barberettes. (EggPlant)In an era when music has become so heavily dependent on technology to lend futuristic and computerized sounds, there’s a local Korean group that has its mind set on turning back the clock to the good old days of mom-and-pop stores, jukeboxes and barbershop quartets -- The Barberettes.The female doo-wop musical trio is one of the fastest growing nonmainstream groups in the Korean music industry today. With their covers of popular hits from the past like “Mr. Sandman” and “Lollipop” as well as original doo-wops, these young 20-somethings successfully reproduce the sounds of their grandparents’ generation and are oftentimes referred to as the time-slip girl group. They also sport a retro-style look reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn. The group is currently composed of members Shinae An Wheeler, Park So-hee Park and Sunnie Lee -- who recently replaced the band’s original member Grace Kim. “We really just started out for fun, to try out new things, something we had never done before,” said Wheeler, the group’s founder, leader, producer and main composer, during an interview on Monday with The Korea Herald at the group’s recording studio in Seongdong-gu, Seoul.“I downloaded this radio smartphone app that had music by categories and this is how I first came to discover retro girl groups,” she added. The Barberettes perform on stage during the group’s nationwide tour earlier this year. (EggPlant)The trio decided to take on a small-time gig in the city’s indie band mecca of Hongdae and the rest is history. “It was clear after our first show, we knew that we had something here,” said Wheeler. Wheeler first started her professional music career at the age of 15 as a backup vocalist and lyricist for a handful of K-pop idol stars including hallyu icon BoA. According to the Federation of Korean Music Performers, she is credited as a vocal participant in 110 songs released since 2002. Most recently the leader cowrote and coproduced YG Entertainment’s rising starlet Lee Hi’s lead single “Hold My Hand” which was part of the singer’s “Seoulite” album released in March. Wheeler admitted she never anticipated the weekly harmony practices with her music school friends would end up leading to the formation of The Barberettes. Since the release of the act’s debut album, “The Barberettes Volume 1” in 2012, the group has performed its throwback singles across the country as well as abroad in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., showing no signs of slowing down. In 2014, the members were invited to perform at Seoul’s annual MU:CON showcase where they were spotted by SXSW general manager James Minor, who invited the women to join the lineup at the 2015 SXSW music showcase festival in Austin, Texas, last March. The Barberettes were selected as one of only five local acts to perform at the internationally renowned showcase. “I think this was the first time that I truly realized that the popularity of hallyu was real, even more than I had ever imagined,” said Park. “I couldn’t believe so many people wanted to attend the ‘K-pop Night Out’ event.”  The Barberettes perform on stage during the group’s nationwide tour earlier this year. (EggPlant)“It was unreal, they were lining up around the block,” Wheeler added. “The show started at around 8 p.m. and people starting lining up at like 8 a.m., and then two hours before the show, there were so many people in line, it had to wrap around the building a couple of times.” Despite sharing the stage with hardcore Korean rock bands and choreography-heavy K-pop idol bands, the ladies were praised for their unique style and their performances made it to numerous “best” lists including NPR’s All Songs Considered and Marie Claire.  “We were a couple of Asian girls who came up and started singing songs that our grandparents used to listen to, so I think people were surprised to hear us, but also were very intrigued by how different we were from all the other bands,” Park says. “And the reaction from the crowd was so great. It was pretty surprising for me.”“I think we are very different and it’s a huge advantage for us,” Wheeler added. “We don’t belong to a pretty girls dance pop band, we don’t belong to the super indie scene, but still we are something that the audience can really relate to. We are very proud of being different.” “There is not really any other girl group that harmonizes vocals like we do,” said Lee. “I haven’t been a member of The Barberettes for very long, but what I can say about our music is that it is very pure and I think that one of the reasons that our songs resonate so well with our listeners.” The ladies’ popularity has proven that despite their non-modern, non-mainstream pursuits in performing musical styles that were considered hip six decades ago, doo-wop music still has a niche in today’s scene and can be appreciated by music lovers, no matter the generation.

(EggPlant)“Oh my god, our parents love our music,” the members said in unison.“Even though our parents and their friends really love our music, we have people of all ages attending our concerts and listening to our songs,” Wheeler explained. “We’ve been told that even babies enjoy listening to our music. I think it’s something about our simple chords progressions ... it makes our songs very easy to listen to.”The Barberettes recently returned from performing two shows at U.K.’s “The Great Escape” new music festival last month, where they caught the eye of music artiste and producer Stuart Zender, known for being an original member and coproducer of Jamiroquai as well as a coproducer for the late Amy Winehouse and Mark Ronson. “We met him at the show and the next thing we knew, he booked a flight to Korea for next month,” says Wheeler. The Barberettes are in the process of recording the act’s second full studio album, which is expected to be released sometime later this year.“The only thing I can really say about our upcoming album is that it will still be our retro sounds but with more pop music,” she added. “Also we will for sure be releasing a new single this month.” Promotional image of the female retro-pop musical trio The Barberettes.

[Feature] Not just window shopping: Young generation dives into art mark...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000226685?sid=104,"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:48:00 +0900","Expectation of stable financial returns, new trading platforms and high liquidity drive interests in art as investmentVisitors at the annual art festival Galleries Art Fair 2020 look at art pieces by visual artist Julian Opie. (Galleries Association of Korea)Appreciating artworks at galleries or exhibitions has been a pure joy for Jeong Hye-young, a 35-year-old office worker in Seoul, not just for finding peace of mind from stress-filled work but also because she sees their rising price value.“I don’t think art is only for the rich. After starting to buy paintings, I feel like I know more about the artists and truly enjoy the artworks,“ said Jeong who has been collecting paintings by contemporary artists including Oh Chi-gyun, best known for his hand-painted “fingerworks.” “Price values of paintings increasing is also an appealing factor of collecting arts that it can be considered as an investment, not just as a subject of appreciation,” said Jeong.Jeong is among a growing number of people, especially those in their 20s and 30s, investing in art.At an auction held on March 23, local auctioneer Seoul Auction sold 95 percent of 146 paintings, prints and sculptures worth 10.4 billion won ($9.2 million) in winning price combined.“Many bidders participating in the auction were those in their 20s and 30s,” the auction company said declining to give numbers, citing protection of personal information.The growing interests in art investment comes in line with the South Korean art market entering a new golden era that went through a long period of depression since its previous heyday between 2005 and 2007.Art pieces by domestic master artists, including the late Kim Tschang-yeul, has been hitting new highs in value with exploding demand, according to a recent report by art appraisal firm Korea Art Authentication & Appraisal Research Center.Not only in South Korea but also in major markets in Asia, art investment has been prevailing in times of ultralow interest rates and high liquidity.A report released by investment bank UBS early in March showed that art broker Sotheby’s reported strong sales in Asia in 2020 with auction sales reaching $932 million. Among other age groups, millennials were more willing to purchase at higher prices online. Of 2,569 rich collectors around the world surveyed in the report, 56 percent were those belonging to the so-called Generation MZ, depicting people born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. The millennials, in particular, spent an average of $228,000 to purchase artworks, and 30 percent of the millennial investors spent more than $1 million.The rising popularity of art investment can be attributed to online platforms that facilitates online auctions and new type of art investment such as co-sharing, like investing in fractional shares, according to market watchers. But investors are drawn to arts because it raises hopes for stable financial returns rather than investing in stocks or cryptocurrency. “Investing in real estate requires a lump sum of money while cryptocurrency is highly risky,” said Song Ja-ho, CEO of art co-sharing platform operator Pica Project. “Those young collectors seem to think art is something special as they can own and enjoy while they can get some financial gain from it,” he added.Another merit of investing in art in Korea is that it is somewhat free from taxation. Buyers of any artwork sold at 60 million won or less is exempted from paying tax. For artworks priced over 60 million, 20 percent of income tax is imposed only on 10 percent of the selling price. Trading of artworks by living artists do not incur any tax. South Korean contemporary artist Park Seo-bo’s painting, “Ecriture No. 030707,” is on the block at Seoul Auction’s latest art auction last week in Seoul. The masterpiece sold for 105 million won ($92,700) at the event. (Seoul Auction)Art, tokenizedOn the Pica Project platform, people can jointly own an expensive masterpiece with as little as 10,000 won. After being displayed at a gallery run by the firm for a while, the artwork is later sold at a premium, and the proceeds are distributed among investors proportionally.Young art collectors also venture to invest in something new, such as nonfungible token, a digital asset that can contain drawings, animated GIFs, and songs. NFTs have been sweeping the conventional art industry as well as cryptocurrency market as some of tokenized paintings are sold for millions of dollars. Riding on the NFT fad, ”Missing and Found,“ a NFT-based digital artwork featuring a big-eyed girl with heavy makeup created by South Korean artist Mari Kim, was sold for 607 million won ($535,250) in a Pica Project auction this month. The digital image, whose starting price was 50 million won, was paid for in Ethereum, a type of cryptocurrency as well known as bitcoin. It is speculated that the buyer is a young tech-savvy art investor.Although the increasing interest toward art is good for the industry, some market watchers say novice art collectors first try to develop an eye for great pieces via extensive research and observation of news and trends.“Fledgling buyers should think twice before they make decisions to collect art pieces, and they should not be easily swayed by others’ opinions when picking an art piece,” said Yoon Bo-hyung, a lawyer and author of an art collecting guidebook titled, ”I choose artworks over Chanel bags.““If you are not so sure about whether to buy a certain art piece or not, then do more research and find something which makes you feel ‘this is it … this is mine,’” she added.By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"

Korean image ambassadors Baby Shark and Delphine O shine light on Korea’...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000224841?sid=104,"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 20:20:00 +0900","Secretary-General of the UN Generation Equality Forum Delphine O (right) and SmartStudy co-founder Lee Seung-gyu (Lim Jang-won / The Korea Herald)The creator of Baby Shark and Secretary-General of the UN Generation Equality Forum Delphine O, winners of awards for helping to promote Korea’s image to the world, have shed light on what direction Korea should take moving forward in a post-COVID-19 era. O and creator Lee Seung-gyu were presented with the awards at the 2021 Corea Image Communication Institute Awards Ceremony at InterContinental Seoul COEX on Thursday. Since 2005, CICI – a nonprofit organization -- has honored cultural figures, organizations or those who made significant contributions to raising awareness of Korean culture around the world. The awards ceremony took place observing the 50-people restriction in place as part of social distancing measures. Chang Jae-bok, ambassador for Public Diplomacy, opened the ceremony, followed by speeches from CJ Group Chair Sohn Kyung-shik and French Ambassador Philippe Lefort. US Ambassador to Korea Harry Harris gave a congratulatory message via video.Performances by magician Ed Kwon and French pansori singer Laure Mafo preceded the awards ceremony, while award winners gave their acceptance speeches and CICI introduced its annual activities.O, a Korean French former member of the French National Assembly, won the Korea Image Stepping Stone Bridge Award given to notable foreigners who have contributed to Korea’s image. Secretary-General of the UN Generation Equality Forum Delphine O (CICI)“I’m very grateful for receiving this award, I’ve been following the CICI ceremony for a number of years and have attended a couple already so I am extremely honored. I think it’s especially important because it is the Stepping Stone Award and as a diplomat my job is to create bridges between people,” O said during a press conference held before the gala event. “I am very proud of my Korean heritage and culture.”O, in her speech, also brought up the issue of how COVID-19 has exacerbated gender discrimination.“Women are pressured to do both household work while working at home,” said O. “Also, those suffering from domestic violence cannot go outside and call for help.”She went on to expand upon issues Korean women face in balancing their career and personal lives.“Korean women are still unable to juggle between raising children and work,” said O. “Women tend to be more willing to adapt to change than men. Korean men need a change in perception and support women’s career more actively.”Participants at the 2021 Korea Image Awards Ceremony on Thursday (Lim Jang-won/The Korea Herald)Popular character Baby Shark, made famous by its catchy children’s song, won the Korea Image Budding Youth Award, given to those under 20. The Baby Shark Dance video currently has over 7.6 billion views and remains the most-watched video on YouTube since Nov. 2. Lee Seung-gyu, co-founder of SmartStudy that created Baby Shark, shared his thoughts on receiving the award on Thursday.“With COVID-19, the number of video plays and the duration of watching videos has increased proportionally with children staying longer hours at home. So the consumption of content like Baby Shark has increased. What’s more important is that in the media industry, the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. Those that are loved by children have a snowball effect while those that don’t have a hard time,” said Lee.Lee said he was honored that Baby Shark was being included as part of the Korean 4Bs -- BTS, Blackpink and director Bong Joon-ho -- Korean individuals and groups that have contributed to the rise and spread of Korean culture worldwide. He hoped the category would expand further and that Baby Shark would one day be included among the 9Bs and 10Bs of Korea.“I hope, like the name Budding Youth Award, SmartStudy can help children grow, like how buds grow into a tree and eventually become part of a forest, more joyfully and meaningfully with our content,” Lee said.“Baby Shark seized the opportunity that opened up with YouTube. New opportunities arise when new platforms are opened,” he said. “We need to be able to quickly decide what are the opportunities and need to adopt, carry forward and make it happen. Secondly, companies need to make innumerable tries at creating content. For that to happen, there needs to be room for failure.”Baby Shark’s catchy tune is not its only reason for success, he said, pointing towards how the accompanying dance moves in the video had enabled families to spend quality time together.“A lot of things these days are called K-content, K-drama and K-food, but I hope the K disappears someday,” Lee said. “I hope we gain the confidence and think of the content that we make as global and sets an example as a global standard.”SmartStudy has created a show on Baby Shark in collaboration with Nickelodeon, which will be shown starting first half of the year, Lee said. The company plans to focus on promotions in North America this year. The TV series will be key to maintaining the longevity of Baby Shark, according to Lee.The third Korea Image Stepping Stone Award went to the top six finalists of TV Chosun’s hit show “Mr. Trot” for representing Korea and promoting the trot genre to the world.“After seeing the lists of award winners for previous years, I am humbled. I think we received this award because we helped trot music shine at a time when everyone was suffering from COVID-19. We will take it as a message for us to keep on singing songs of condolence and hope,” said Lee Chan-won, one of the finalists. “Moving forward, we want to show trot to the world.”By Lim Jang-won (ljw@heraldcorp.com)[네이버에서 코리아헤럴드 구독]▶ KH Podcast     ▶ KH Video<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"

"[Digital Simplicity] IU, 8K display and next-generation gaming",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000222011?sid=004,"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 16:01:00 +0900","Last Saturday, singer IU’s newest live performance video was revealed on YouTube. It was a landmark event since the video was formatted in 8K resolution, which easily outperforms 4K display.A small number of those who purchased the prohibitively expensive and visually expansive 88-inch OLED TV from LG Electronics were lucky enough to get a glimpse of what the 8K technology could offer, thanks to the stunning image featuring IU’s equally exquisite live performance.Just in case you have no idea who IU is, let me introduce her a bit. IU (whose name is Lee Ji-eun) is a top singer-songwriter and actress and has a huge fan base here -- so much so that a lot of Korean music fans helplessly stick to home-grown streaming music services largely because Apple Music, apparently due to copyright and contract issues, does not provide her music in the Korean market.The 8K video uploaded on YouTube, in which IU belted out her hit song “You & I” on “You Heeyeol’s Sketchbook” music program, garnered more than 500,000 views, and is now deemed as a reference to check whether your 8K display works properly. I watched the video with a new 4K computer monitor I bought recently. It was immensely impressive, even on 4K display. When I raised the resolution setting from 4K to 8K (fully aware that my screen is not designed to support 8K) on YouTube, the screen froze. It seems that my computer system, even with high-end options, found it hard to handle the enormous amount of digital data needed to stream 8K video.What should be noted is that KBS, a state-run TV station which aired the special program, recorded IU’s performance in 8K resolution but opted for YouTube to distribute the showcase piece. Under the current TV infrastructure, local TV stations are ill-equipped to broadcast 8K video seamlessly. I reckon that this is why KBS decided to let those who have 8K TVs and top-end desktop computers check out the eye-popping quality of the video through YouTube. For 8K TV makers such as LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics, IU’s live performance video is a blessing. Thanks to the high-profile video whose view count is likely to go up on the strength of IU’s popularity, TV makers can expect that the next-generation TV would be more readily accepted in the market, accelerating the shift from 4K to 8K. A similar technological shift is underway in the gaming industry. Both Microsoft and Sony are now getting ready to launch their next-generation video consoles later this year, promising better graphics and performance. The new machines support 4K video at 128 frames per second, a clear upgrade from today’s mainstream gaming systems.Microsoft, in particular, pins high hopes on Xbox Game Pass, a video game subscription service, which is “Netflix for video games.” Many Korean gamers at major online communities are talking about whether such subscription services could succeed, especially after Microsoft surprised the market this week by acquiring renowned US-based game developer Bethesda for $7.5 billion. Some users are considering PC-based gameplay after buying a Xbox Game Pass, while bypassing the purchase of the new console. The reason is the much-awaited debut of next-generation graphics cards, namely Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 series.On Wednesday, two US tech YouTubers -- Marques Brownlee and Linus Sebastian -- rolled out videos introducing the sizzling appeal of 8K gaming powered by RTX 3090 graphics cards. Both videos were based on LG’s 88-inch OLED TV, whose retail price in Korea is set at more than 44 million won (about $37,000). To enjoy watching IU’s live performance in 8K format on a big screen, you would have to spend a lot of money upgrading your desktop computer system. The full-fledged 8K video, whether it’s a live performance on YouTube or gaming, requires the latest CPU, graphics card, TV set and other related components for a powerful desktop PC. Is it worth it? If you watch IU’s performance in 4K or lower resolution and find it good enough, a pricey upgrade to the 8K computer system could be premature. After all, 8K technology will eventually replace 4K in the coming years. Until then, many IU fans will likely feel that their smartphone screen is big enough as long as they can watch her impeccable performance.

Andrea Natale, M.D., F.H.R.S., F.A.C.C., F.E.S.C., cardiac electrophysiologist and executive medical director of TCAI, and Amin Al-Ahmad, M.D., cardiac electrophysiologist at TCAI, recently participated in the first-in-human trials of this catheter in Europe, in preparation for conducting in-human trials at St. David's Medical Center in Central Texas next year. What distinguishes this catheter―the NuVision™ ICE Catheter―from previous versions is 4D imaging, which is designed to better guide complex cardiac procedures, improve outcomes and reduce procedure times, all of which are beneficial to the patient. ""As ablation technologies continue to evolve, and procedures become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for advanced intracardiac imaging beyond the capabilities of 3D imaging,"" Dr. Natale said. ""4D imaging provides a high-resolution view of the heart structure during a complex intervention to lessen the likelihood of complications during ablation procedures. We are committed to providing leading-edge treatment to our patients, and we look forward to bringing this important advancement to St. David's Medical Center.""This catheter offers all of the imaging capabilities of previous imaging platforms with the added spatial benefits of real-time intracardiac 3D guidance, giving physicians an advanced view of the heart in motion during complex structural heart surgeries, appendage closures and cardiac ablation procedures. This enhanced visualization allows physicians to better assess complex cardiac structures with the potential to improve patient outcomes while reducing procedure times and fluoroscopy (X-ray) exposure. It also gives physicians better control of the image generation by allowing them to guide the catheter throughout the procedure.""Through the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David's Medical Center, we are committed to advancing the level of care for patients with cardiac conditions,"" Dr. Al-Ahmad said. ""Having the ability to view direct images of a procedure in real time allows us to more safely and effectively treat patients.""4D imaging also allows doctors to perform structural heart procedures under conscious sedation, which is associated with a lower risk of complications for patients.Media Contact:    Erin Ochoa    Elizabeth Christian Public Relations    EOchoa@EChristianPR.com     512.788.1616 cellSource: Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David's Medical Center[편집자 주] 본고는 자료 제공사에서 제공한 것으로, 연합뉴스는 내용에 대해 어떠한 편집도 하지 않았음을 밝혀 드립니다.▶코로나19 속보는 네이버 연합뉴스[구독 클릭]▶[팩트체크] 코로나19가 탈모 원인?▶제보하기"
Samsung Expands Advanced 0.7μm-Pixel ISOCELL Image Sensor Offerings for...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002091730?sid=105,"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 15:20:00 +0900","- Compact chips boast industry’s smallest pixel size, allowing sleeker designs and minimized camera bumps   By Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, September 15, 2020- Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today introduced four new Samsung ISOCELL image sensors for its 0.7 micrometer (μm)-pixel product lineup; 108-megapixel (Mp) ISOCELL HM2, 64Mp ISOCELL GW3, 48Mp ISOCELL GM5 and 32Mp ISOCELL JD1. With the new 0.7μm ISOCELL technology, Samsung plans to expand the ultra-high-resolution offerings to mainstream smartphones.    “Samsung continues to pioneer innovations, such as ISOCELL Plus and Smart ISO, to deliver more pixels in a smaller package,” said Yongin Park, executive vice president of the sensor business at Samsung Electronics. “Last year, Samsung introduced the industry’s first 0.7μm-pixel image sensor and the first 108Mp sensors. Now we are bringing more of the advanced pixel technologies to mobile cameras in a variety of options that will enable high-resolution images and sleeker designs in a wider selection of tomorrow’s mobile devices.”   For ultra-high-resolution image sensors, even a mere 0.1μm-difference per pixel can have a significant impact on the overall size of the sensor as well as the height of the camera module. With pixels at 0.7μm, Samsung’s newest image sensors are up to 15-percent smaller than the 0.8μm sensors of the same resolution and reduce the height of the camera module by up to 10 percent. Smaller form factors give smartphone manufacturers more flexibility, such as added features or more streamlined designs, when developing their next-generation devices.    To collect an ample amount of light and increase the full well capacity despite the minute pixel sizes, Samsung has incorporated its advanced ISOCELL Plus and Smart-ISO technologies, especially optimized for 0.7μm. ISOCELL Plus retains the received light with a wall-like structure around the pixel while Smart-ISO makes full use of the incoming light by intelligently adjusting the ISO accordingly for optimal exposure.    In the latest 0.7μm products to be introduced later this year, Samsung will start rolling out an enhanced pixel technology, ISOCELL 2.0, which allows excellent performance despite the challenges with decreasing pixel sizes. The new technology further enhanced the wall structure between cells, resulting in added light sensitivity of up to 12 percent compared to the current ISOCELL Plus technology.   ISOCELL HM2 is Samsung’s third 108Mp image sensor following the HMX and HM1. The new 108Mp-sensor is around 15-percent smaller than the 0.8μm-based predecessors, and reduces the height of the camera module by 10 percent. The HM2 features Super PD, a faster and more effective phase detecting auto focus solution, and like the HM1, comes with a nine-pixel binning technology as well as 3x lossless zoom.    ISOCELL GW3 is a 64Mp-image sensor optimized for mainstream devices. Thanks to the smaller pixel size, the GW3’s optical size is nearly identical to that of Samsung’s 0.8μm 48Mp image sensor. In addition to Tetracell and Smart-ISO technologies that help the sensor take bright images with high color fidelity, the GW3 is ideal for active lifestyles, featuring gyro-based electronic image stabilization (EIS) for sharper still photos and steadier videos. The image sensor supports video recording at up to 4K resolution at 60 frames-per-second (fps).    ISOCELL GM5 is a versatile 48Mp-image sensor designed for use in telescoping or ultra-wide angle cameras. When used as a 5x optical telescoping sensor for folded-zoom, the GM5 takes full advantage of the compact 0.7μm pixel size that minimizes the camera bulge. For ultra-wide shots, the GM5 supports high-speed full-HD recording at 480fps. The sensor also offers a staggered-HDR feature, a faster and more power-efficient HDR technology that expedites image processing by sending a readout of long, medium, and short exposures of each row of pixels respectively to the mobile processor. As the readout is performed based on Tetracell’s 1.4μm two-by-two pixels, rather than at the individual 0.7μm-pixel level, staggered-HDR can provide brighter and clearer images with less noise.    ISOCELL JD1 is the industry’s smallest 32Mp-image sensor at 1/3.14-inches, making it an ideal solution for smartphones with bezel-less displays that incorporate a hole-in-active-area or motorized pop-up mechanism for the front-facing camera. Even with 32-million pixels to capture a highly detailed selfie, the camera sits comfortably under the display as the height of the sensor’s camera module is comparable to those of 0.9μm 20Mp or 1.0μm 16Mp sensors. Like the GM5, the JD1 is also the one the first ISOCELL image sensors to offer staggered-HDR.    Samsung ISOCELL HM2, GW3 and JD1 are currently in mass production, and the company is sampling GM5.▶ 네이버에서 디지털데일리 채널 구독하기▶ IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드 [딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>		"

Swept up by girl groups,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/441/0000008008?sid=104,"Sat, 05 Aug 2017 04:01:00 +0900","			The hottest term in Korea at the moment is none other than “girl group.” They can be seen on every screen, appearing in TV dramas, entertainment shows and even documentaries. Leaping beyond the boundaries of generation and gender, these pop groups are lighthearted, sincere and now stand in a position where every move they make sparks a new trend. Just what is it about them that drives us into such a frenzy? Inside a typical record shop is a man, in his mid-40s, nonchalantly pushing a CD of the young girl group 2NE1 over the countertop. There's a hint of embarrassment on his face. After stealing a quick glance at the clerk, he mumbles: “My daughter is a fan.” The cashier gives his customer a meaningful smile and replies, “They're really good. I like them a lot too.” Sensing his mind was all too-easily read, the man puts on a straight face and insists, “No, it's not for me, but for my daughter.” But it's too late, the words already sound like an excuse. The clerk's smile widens. “These days there are many older men and women who come in to buy 2NE1 CDs.” The middle-aged man hurriedly shoves his purchase into his bag and returns to the streets. He ponders his situation: Who would have thought a man in his 40s would buy an album by a teenage girl group, after convincing himself it was for his daughter, then go home to sing the songs with his kids?What first made this middle-aged man fall for pop bands (commonly referred to as idol groups in Korea) was a Girls' Generation's concert he went to with his grade school daughter. At first he wasn't thrilled about the show, as it felt more of a playground for teenagers than a setting for a father. But once he was there, he encountered a sight he'd never expected to see. The crowd lined at the entrance was composed of such a diversity of people, males and females of all ages, from teens to the middle-aged. Older men and women alike were proudly standing in line holding the hands of their children, who were in turn carrying posters and CDs in their arms. The man's apprehension dissipated at the sight of them. Once inside the concert hall, he saw that the venue was packed, from the standing section lining the stage, to the seats on the second floor. Though the man had attended several concerts in his youth, the scene of men and women of all ages mingling was a foreign one. However, that feeling soon faded as Girls' Generation came on stage and began singing and dancing their adorable, trademark moves. The issue of age was forgotten by everyone in the concert hall, and they all went wild together. WAVES OF INFLUENCE These episodes from the record store and music venue are ones you would have never seen in the past. The target demographics for pop bands remained those still in the middle of their teenage years. In the 1990s, when the Korean pop scene thrived, the audience expanded to include those in their 20s. Fans organized official clubs, went to shows to chase after their stars, camped in front of singers' houses and screamed with joy at a sighting. Back then, older folks would look at the crazed youths with awe. Their typical response was to cluck their tongues and scold the youngsters for “recklessly chasing singers when they ought to be studying hard for their futures.”However, 20 years later, things have changed again. The generation that once devoted themselves to fan clubs has now reached the midway point in their lives. Now they nod their heads knowingly at those from younger generations and, furthermore, they're willing to sit with them, listen to a newlybought CD, hum tunes in a car, and even go to concerts. The formal term of endearment for this age group is “uncle and auntie fans.” And, at the center of all this change are the girl groups, who seem to have something for everyone. To elders, these charismatic performers remind them of their youth: to men, they are beautiful eye candy; to women, they provide a refreshing energy that helps liven dull days and erase frustration with bold, simple messages. Idol girl groups, in mere years, have become an entity that brings together generations, as opposed to serving as a distinctive divider. Just when and how did this unique movement manifest? Was it when the Wonder Girls rocked the entire nation with their echoing rhythm to the lyrics of “Tell Me”? Or was it when the retro feel of the hit song “Nobody” made people's hearts beat with excitement? Maybe it was when the refreshing Girls' Generation seduced audiences with their long-legged dance to the enchanting “Say Your Wish.” The possibilities are endless, but what's certain is that girl idol groups have made their way into our lives. No matter our age or gender, these girls allow us to dream once again, moving us with their cheerfulness and a feeling of fresh radiance. The vibrancy of their songs, dances, clothes and performances is so irresistible that every move is picked up by the world's pop radar. They render the term “singer” insufficient. They are at the edge of the frontier of popular culture, but they are not just pioneers ? they are the culture.THE SHADOW OF RECESSION AND NOSTALGIA Some are so surprised by the elder generation's enthusiasm for girl groups that they cannot help but mention the Lolita complex. Nevertheless, that would be an example of an exaggerated principle that remains from the past authoritarian era. In the course of shifting from a masculine-dominated era to one of feminine equality, the imposing frames of age and gender are being slowly torn down. The time has come in pop culture where a man in his 40s can cheer for teenage girl groups without being looked at suspiciously. Additionally, the craze for girl groups has inseparable ties with the long and difficult recession. Retro trends are born because contemporary troubles lead people to reminisce about past glory days. In this way, the energetic youth of idol groups brings a sense of longing to people looking back on their prime. Wanting to return to those days of joy and resilience, of endless youth, is understandable, and even amplified during times of hardship. Girl groups have seemingly materialized for the Korean public at just the right moment. They are the consolation of finding an oasis in the banal desert of everyday life, the time machine that brings us back to the light memory of youth, and the messengers of pop culture announcing the end of an era and the coming of the next. So, why should there be shame or embarrassment at finding peace and nostalgia for a few moments, or enjoying a new cultural movement? Seeing a father singing along with his daughter to a girl group's song in a karaoke room has become a natural scene in Korea. The culture has changed and the ubiquitous girl group is simply a representation of progress.Though this idol fever may look like a simple fandom phenomenon created by singers and their enthused fans, the picture reflects a much deeper image. Each generation has lived in an era of the shadow of recession, and is now escaping a constricting ideology by gathering behind a new icon of the era. Girl groups are one of the symbols at the center, inciting a new age and time.

LG And SES to Demonstrate 4K High Frame Rate Technology at SES Industry ...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002050665?sid=105,"Wed, 17 May 2017 09:35:00 +0900","- Next-Generation Feature of Ultra HD to be Transmitted Live on LG OLED TV via ASTRA SatelliteBy Yun Sang-hocrow@ddaily.co.kr[Digital Daily]Seoul, Korea, May 17, 2017- SES and LG Electronics (LG) will demonstrate OLED TV’s cutting-edge 4K High Frame Rate (HFR) broadcast at the tenth SES Industry Days conference in Luxembourg, on 16 and 17 May. The 4K HFR content will be transmitted live via an ASTRA satellite at 19.2 degrees East and displayed on LG’s OLED TV using a prototype HFR software. This demonstration will offer visitors the opportunity to experience the highly improved image quality of next generation 4K HFR broadcast content. HFR is a new broadcast technology that enhances the quality of 4K Ultra HD images by increasing frames per second (FPS) up to 120, the maximum for broadcast content, compared to most current content which typically supports 50 FPS content. The enhanced FPS rate is particularly beneficial to feature fast action such as sports with lifelike, highly fluid images, while eliminating motion-related picture degradation found on conventional TVs such as motion blur and judder. In addition to display manufacturers, global broadcasters and content providers are also preparing for the launch of the second phase of Ultra HD using the DVB UHD-1 Phase 2 specification, which features 4K HFR technology. The UHD-1 Phase 2 standard includes other cutting-edge technologies such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Next-generation Audio (NGA).“We are very excited to demonstrate just how effective LG’s OLED TV is as a platform for 4K HFR and other high grade content,” said Sam Kim, senior vice president and head of TV product planning at the LG Home Entertainment Company. “LG is committed to offering consumers around the world the latest in TV technologies and High Frame Rate on OLED TVs must be seen to be believed. Watching 4K HFR content on an OLED TV as it’s being transmitted in real time by ASTRA’s satellite is a great example of pushing the limits of current TV technologies.” “SES has been steadily pushing forward development of Ultra HD and the Industry Days event has always been an excellent platform to showcase new TV technology,” said Thomas Wrede, vice president New Technology & Standards at SES. “High frame rate will be an important step towards further enhancing the quality of Ultra HD satellite transmissions, in particular for sports and reality TV events. Our continued partnership with LG Electronics is important in setting the broadcast standards of tomorrow and for pioneering future TV technologies and we are very pleased to work with LG Electronics on such an important milestone.”IT언론의 새로운 대안[디지털데일리]IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]윤상호(crow@ddaily.co.kr)<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>		"

Google to commercialize artificial intelligence to detect diseases,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000186512?sid=004,"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 15:20:00 +0900","(123RF)With the recent advances in artificial intelligence, Google has been working to apply a form of high-level AI computing known as deep learning to the field of medicine and health care.Though further developments are underway, Google said Thursday that it has successfully developed new deep learning algorithms that can detect and diagnose diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease which can lead to blindness, as well as locate breast cancer.Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research, shared how the US tech giant is using deep learning to train machines to analyze medical images and automatically detect pathological cues, be it swollen blood vessels in the eye or cancerous tumors, during a video conference with the South Korean media hosted by Google Korea.Based on the workings of the human brain, deep learning uses large artificial neural networks -- layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, allowing computers to self-learn without the need for human programming.“Artificial neural networks have been around since the 1960s. But now with more powerful computing power, we can build more layers into the system to handle more complicated tasks with high accuracy,” Peng said.“In deep learning, the feature engineering is handled by the computer itself. We don’t tell the networks what the feature is, but we give them lots of examples, and have the network itself determine what these features are on their own.”On the medical front, Google has made significant progress on building an algorithm to read retinal scan images to discern signs of diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness in the world. Diabetic retinopathy can be detected through regular eye exams. Doctors pictures of patients’ eyes with a special camera and check for the disease based on the amount of visible hemorrhages.“Unfortunately in many parts of the world, there are not enough doctors to do this grading,” Peng said. In India, there is a shortage of 127,000 eye doctors while 45 percent of patients suffer vision loss before diagnosis,” said Peng, who is also a clinical scientist.Therefore, Google designed an AI algorithm to analyze retinal images and identify features of diabetic retinopathy. The program was exposed to 128,000 retinal images labeled by 54 ophthalmologists. Labeling took place multiple times for each image to account for diagnostic variability among doctors, it said.As the algorithm has shown high accuracy, Google has now moved to build an interface and hardware into which doctors in India can input a retinal image and immediately receive a grade for diabetic retinopathy. The firm continues to optimize its machine to improve user convenience and plans to conduct more clinical trials to secure regulatory approval, according to Peng.Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research, speaks during a video conference organized by Google Korea on Thursday. (Google Korea)Another field spearheading Google’s deep learning push is cancer detection. The tech giant is developing another deep learning algorithm that surveys biopsy images to locate metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.“What we’re trying to do is find out where there is a little bit of breast cancer in the lymph node, which helps determine what stage of cancer the patient is in and guides treatment,” Peng said.Google’s AI algorithm achieved a tumor localization score -- how accurately it can locate the cancerous tumor -- of 0.89, exceeding the score of 0.73 from a highly-trained human pathologist with unlimited time for examination.Peng, however, pointed to the algorithm’s shortcomings in its biopsy readings. The algorithm was tested against slides containing 10,000 to 400,000 images, of which 20 to 150,000 showed tumors. Google’s algorithm located tumors with a sensitivity of 92 percent, but this was when set to allow eight false positive readings per slide.On the other hand, human doctors had a locational sensitivity of 73 percent, but zero false positives -- meaning they were less efficient at finding tumors but never identified normal tissue as a tumor. “If you combine the machine and the pathologist reading the slide, you’d have a very optimal situation where you have low false negative (diagnoses) and high sensitivity (for tumor location),” Peng said.The Google researcher said it will take some time before devices running on Google’s deep learning algorithms are commercialized for use in the medical sector, as it must secure sufficient clinical data proving their efficacy and accuracy before seeking regulatory approval.On concerns that Google’s next-generation medical image analysis tools could be subject to tougher regulations given their novelty, Peng said that the US Food and Drug Administration holds a “neutral” or “objective” approach to the devices, as they fall within an existing product category.The US FDA considers the new devices simply as upgraded versions of existing medical imaging and processing devices that can be approved as long as their claimed functions are backed by sufficient evidence, she said.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"

ETRI(한국전자통신연구원)는 홀로그램 영상을 표시하는 액정의 픽셀을 1마이크로미터(㎛) 수준으로 만드는데 성공했다고 2일 밝혔다. 홀로그램 영상은 액정에 전압을 걸어 빛의 위상, 편광을 변경해 만들어진다. 이때 액정 픽셀의 크기가 작을수록 영상의 화질이 좋아지고 시야각이 넓어진다. 하지만 픽셀 크기를 줄이는데 한계가 있어 지금까지 3.8㎛ 수준에 그쳤다.  연구진은 반도체 메모리 소자로 연구되었던 상전이 물질(GST)을 이용해 1㎛ 크기의 픽셀을 구현하는데 성공했다. 상전이 물질은 비정질 상태와 결정질 상태를 가질 수 있어 투과율과 굴절률의 조절이 가능하다. 연구진은 인듐 주석 산화물(ITO) 사이에 상전이 물질을 쌓는 방식으로 홀로그램 소자를 만들었다. 상전이 물질층의 두께를 유지하면서 투명전극 층의 두께를 조절할 수 있어 별도의 컬러 필터 공정 없이도 다양한 색상의 홀로그램 이미지 생성이 가능하다.【대전=뉴시스】국내 연구진이 만든 상전이 홀로그램 패널에서 재생된 홀로그램 이미지.

"Hallyu bets on beauty, fashion to go global",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000116970?sid=104,"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 19:46:00 +0900","  Korea boosts its brand value across the globe Fashionistas around the world may soon be adding a new city to their list of fashion capitals alongside Paris, New York, London and Milan.With its up-and-coming designers and beautiful celebrities Seoul is preparing to become the world’s next fashion and beauty destination.Greeting President Lee Myung-bak and his wife at the White House during the Seoul-Washington summit last year, first lady Michelle Obama was clad in a distinguished purple dress designed by Korean-American designer Doori Chung.Chung, who recently told the press in New York that Korea is her “root and strength,” is among the growing number of young Korean designers spreading their reach throughout New York and Europe.Local fashion brands including O’2nd and Hexa by Kuho have also managed to enter the U.S. market, with O’2nd opening a store in CO-OP Barneys New York and Hexa by Kuho introduced at the IF Boutique, a luxury store in the U.S.The explosive popularity of K-pop in Asia and Europe has also piqued the younger generation’s interest in Korean fashion items and cosmetics.With a growing number of people searching online for the fashion items worn by their favorite Korean stars, sites selling Korea-made products are receiving more overseas customers.“We’ve always had orders coming in from outside the country, but they were mostly Koreans. Since about two years ago, however, we have noticed Japanese names written in Korean letters,” Ahn Jin-hyun, CEO of popular online shopping mall sallyslaw.com, said.“I have no idea how these Japanese got to know about us. We can only guess that it must have something to do with the popularity of Korean celebrities in Japan,” Ahn added.Netstar, an online store run by a Korean CEO, was recently ranked in the top 10 at Japan’s largest internet shopping portal rakuten.co.jp as the first foreigner-operated mall. Launched in 2007, Netstar sells women’s clothing, much of which has been featured in popular Korean TV dramas.Local cosmetic brands such as Missha, The Face Shop, Nature Republic and Skin Food have also been doing well in Asian countries largely due to their relatively low prices and promotion strategies based on hallyu stars.Missha has the largest number of overseas branches among local cosmetic firms, currently running some 900 stores in 25 countries including Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand.Hoping to become a global brand early on, Missha in 2004 focused on using popular Korean Wave stars such as BoA, Kim Hye-soo and Lee Byung-hun as models to win the hearts of foreign customers.Japan and China are Missha’s two major target countries.“We are currently stocking products in more than 3,000 drugstores in Japan. The company has been very much aware of the effect hallyu has on our sales for the past decade,” said Shin Eun-kyung, Missha’s PR official.Industry insiders and government officials note the importance of “image-making” to boost the fashion and beauty sector.“One of the biggest achievements of hallyu is what it did to the image of Korea,” Lee Charm, president of Korea Tourism Organization, said. “Korean stars have helped make everything about Korea ― its fashion, food and so on ― trendy.”  According to a study released by the Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange in December, hallyu earned the country at least 4.98 trillion won in 2010, an increase of 1 trillion won from the previous year.The study is based on various statistics including a survey on 2,000 people in their teens to 40s from five different countries including China and Japan.Japan remained the No.1 market for hallyu, followed by Taiwan, China, Vietnam and Thailand. And the boost in the cultural sector due to hallyu created some 51,500 new jobs in 2010, the study showed.While tourism showed the largest growth of 32 percent from 2009, the music and film industry raked in surprisingly little profit with smaller-than-expected exports, the study also showed.The K-pop sector, however, played the largest role in enhancing Korea’s national image, with Girls’ Generation, Big Bang and Jang Keun-suk rated highest among Korean musicians overseas.To help more of its brands and designers become noticed overseas, Korea plans to continue holding mega-size fashion shows outside the country in 2012.Sponsored by the KTO, fashion shows introducing major Korean clothing brands and up-and-coming designers will be held in cities in Europe, Japan and elsewhere this year, joined by leaders of hallyu who will perform on stage or take to the catwalk.Another sector that has expanded together with hallyu is medical tourism.Establishing the Korea Medical Tourism Association in 2008, the Korean government has been increasing efforts to draw foreign visitors to the country for medical checkups and surgery by linking high-quality medical services with sightseeing and shopping opportunities.Korea attracted some 110,000 patients from abroad last year, an increase of 30 percent from the 81,800 in 2010. A substantial proportion of those patients are estimated to have visited the country for cosmetic surgery, according to government data. The government aims to increase the figure to 300,000 by 2015.The amount is still relatively small compared to the 1.56 million visiting Thailand and the 720,000 choosing to go to Singapore, but more people have been choosing Korea over Japan, which had been one of the most popular destinations for medical tourism before the March 11 earthquake and tsunami last year.The Korean government is paying special attention to the field as “medical tourists” generally spend a longer period of time in Korea and spend more money.Korea has made 350 billion won from medical tourism with the profit expected to reach 1.27 trillion won in 2015 and 5.5 trillion won by 2020.“We are expecting at least 150,000 visitors in 2012 coming in for cosmetic surgery,” said Han Yu-ok of the KTO medical tourism bureau. “We see great potential in the area as women in the neighboring countries are generally more sensitive about fashion and beauty.”  About 70 percent of Korea’s medical tourists are Chinese, seeking to look like their favorite TV stars such as Song Hye-kyo and Choi Ji-woo, according to plastic surgeons.“Because foreign patients have different facial structures compared to Koreans, we make an effort to recognize the patient’s overall features ahead of counseling,” said Lee Geum-joo, director of Bitnara Plastic Surgery Clinic in Sinsa-dong, Seoul.“Korea has a long history in the cosmetic surgery sector. We are glad to be sharing the techniques and be seen as a part of hallyu,” she said.Foreign language-services, provision of comfortable accommodation, fine meals and after-surgery leisure activities are keys to the success of medical tourism, Lee added.By Shin Hae-in (hayney@heraldm.com)"

But his controversial comments and stubbornness are the very facets that keep Lee publicly visible, and as potential presidential candidate.President Roh Moo-hyun`s administration is currently suffering fast diminishing public support after a series of scandals involving alleged influence-peddling by Roh confidants and a strained relationship with the ruling Uri Party.The prospects of the governing camp grasping political power again in 2007 also appear to be dimming somewhat, going by recent polls. According to a survey by the Korea Social Opinion Institute earlier this month, over 38 percent of the 700 adults polled nationwide favored the main opposition Grand National Party to take over the reins of power in 2007; only 21 percent supported Uri.Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, the ruling camp`s frontrunner for the 2007 presidential elections, was the fourth most popular candidate, with a mere 8 percent, trailing former Prime Minister Goh Kun, GNP leader Park Geun-hye and Seoul City Mayor Lee Myung-bak, with a mere 8 percent,  While Chung`s support decreased, Prime Minister Lee enjoyed a slight rise in popularity, closing in to cut the gap with Chung to less than 1 percent. Lee also went ahead of Health and Welfare Minister Kim Geun-tae, who had been second to Chung among Uri hopefuls since last year.Unlike Chung and Kim, who freely express their presidential ambitions, Lee has shown no ambition publicly for the presidency, repeating that ""a prime minister should never lay his eyes on the presidential house."" Lee is well-known for his harsh remarks and stubborn refusal never to apologize for whatever he has said. Although his sharp tongue does not appear to help his popularity among fellow politicians, it appears to attract the younger voters.According to another poll taken by the KSOI focusing on the two ministers and the premier, Lee enjoyed overwhelming popularity among younger voters in their 20s, with 44 percent supporting him, compared to only 28 and 19 percent for Chung and Kim, respectively.""Lee`s radical reformist drives and his straightforward attitude seem to appeal to the younger voters,"" said Kwon Gil-young, an official at KSOI. ""One college student told me the prime minister was the type to snap rather than bend, and that`s why he liked him."" Last year, Lee caused nearly a month of suspension in the National Assembly by calling the conservative GNP ""a party of bribes"" and refusing to apologize afterwards. Recently he triggered another major dispute within the ruling camp by telling a group of graduate students in a lecture at Seoul National University that the president`s men must be ""kept in check"" for corruption and abuse of powers.Many experts, however, view Lee`s growing popularity as merely a passing phase.""Although Lee is a meticulous and a skillful administrator, his visibility to the public is too weak for him to be a competent presidential candidate,"" said professor Yoon Young-o of Kookmin University. ""There is a definite difference between an administrator and a politician, and Lee does not have the personality or the characteristics of a leader."" Professor Kim Il-young of Sungkyunkwan University agreed.""President Roh allowed the prime minister more powers than any former presidents had,"" he said. ""But until now, Lee has not shown clear achievements to prove his capability to line him up as the frontrunner for the presidential race."" Kim added that Lee`s biting comments also hinder him from developing a solid group of political aides to prepare for the next presidential elections. ""How would Lee manage to lead the nation, when he has a problem finding a group of aides?"" Kim asked.Party insiders, however, are keeping close watch on Lee and the circumstances surrounding him.They regard Lee`s popularity among youngsters as a major factor that could turn the situation around. Not many experts had predicted a Roh win in the 2002 presidential elections, but the overwhelming support from the younger generation pushed him into the presidency.Thus, should Lee manage to keep up his popularity among the younger generation with a stronger reformist image, he many have a good chance of becoming the next president, they predict.Since succeeding former Premier Goh Kun last June, Lee has been playing a major role in running state-affairs with the president`s full support. Roh`s faith in Lee comes from his past activities as a staunch democrat with a reputation for openness in dealing with state problems and the driving force to settle issues promptly.Compared to his potential rivals, Ministers Chung and Kim, Lee is able to stay in closer contact with Roh as his right-hand man, which is an obvious advantage. But concentrating only on his role of a prime minister, Lee has stayed relatively clear of being drawn into the power plays by presidential hopefuls, albeit drawing support from the younger generation which dislikes political power struggles vehemently.To top it all, some Uri reformists are making moves to bolster up Lee.For the moment, Uri`s pragmatists appear to have the upper hand in the long dispute between reform or pragmatism, with the moderate Moon Hee-sang becoming the party leader in April.Minister Chung has been outspokenly supporting the pragmatic camp and Chairman Moon since the April leadership elections, while Minister Kim supports the reformist camp, although much weakly.Amid Kim`s weak support and his apparently diminishing popularity, Uri`s reformist factions are showing signs of turning to the progressive prime minister instead, sources say.Premier Lee, who has a clearer reformist stance compared to Minister Kim, has been keeping in close contact with staunchly progressive Rep. Ryu Si-min, backing up the views of Lee and reformists joining hands.But conservative political experts dismiss such talk as a mere presumption.""Prime Minister Lee is still not a strong enough candidate for the reformists to push for 2007,"" said political commentator Jung Chang-in of the Institute of Korean Political Studies.""To many younger Uri reformists Lee is still regarded as an `old` politician who also served former President Kim Dae-jung, which will become a major obstacle in their joining hands."" The 53-year-old prime minister entered the world of politics at the age of 36. A five-term lawmaker, he was a key member of the Kim Dae-jung administration, serving briefly as education minister in 1998.In 2002 he headed Roh`s election committee.Although appraised as a sharp administrator with acute foresight and logic, many regard Lee as more of a ""right-hand man"" than a leader, due to his lack of public friendliness. Opposition lawmakers often criticize him as ""a man of superior talents and inferior virtue.""  (hayney@heraldm.com)  By Shin Hae-in   신랄한 말투와 “내가 최고”라는 식의 태도를 가진 이해찬 국무총리는 국민이나 같은 정치인들간의 인기투표에는 관심이 없는 것 같다. 그러나 논란거리를 만드는 그의 발언이라든지 고집스러움이야말로 이 총리가 국민에게 부각되고 또 대통령 후보 물망에 오르게 하는 요소다.노무현 정부는 대통령 측근이 외압을 행사했다는 의혹이 이어지고 또 여당인 우리당과의 관계가 악화되면서 현재 급속도로 국민의 지지를 잃고 있다.여권이 2007년에 재집권할 전망도 최근 설문조사를 보면 다소는 약해진 것 같다. 한국여론조사연구소가 이달에 앞서 조사한 바에 따르면 전국 성인 700명 중 38퍼센트가 2007년 집권당으로 한나라당을 선호했고 불과 21퍼센트만이 우리당을 지지했다.여당의 2007년 대선 선두주자인 정동영 통일부 장관은 8퍼센트로 인기면에서 고건 전 총리, 박근혜 한나라당 대표 그리고 이명박 서울시장에 이어 4위였다.정 장관의 지지율이 하락하는 반면에 이 총리는 정 장관에게 1퍼센트 미만 차이로 따라 붙으며 인기가 소폭 상승했다. 이 총리는 또 작년부터 우리당 내에서 정 장관 다음가는 후보로 손꼽히는 김근태 보건복지부 장관보다 앞섰다.대권에 대한 야심을 자유롭게 표시하는 정 장관과 김 장관과는 달리 이 총리는 “국무총리는 청와대로 눈을 돌려서는 안 된다’는 말을 거듭하며 대권에 대한 야심을 드러내지 않았다.이 총리는 신랄한 말투와 자신의 말에 대해 절대 사과하지 않는 고집으로 유명하다. 그의 독설이 동료 정치인 사이에서는 인기에 보탬이 되는 것 같지 않지만 젊은 유권자들의 마음은 끄는 것으로 보인다.KSOI가 두 장관과 총리만에 국한하여 실시한 다른 조사에 따르면 이 총리는 20대 청년층에서 지지율 44퍼센트로 압도적인 인기를 누렸고 정 장관과 김 장관은 각각 28퍼센트와 19퍼센트였다.“이 총리의 급진적인 개혁 드라이브와 솔직한 태도가 젊은 층에 어필하는 것 같다”고 KOSI의 권길영씨가 말했다. “한 대학생은 국무총리가 굽히기 보다는 꺾이고자 하는 타입이라서 그를 좋아한다고 내게 말했다.”  작년에 이 총리는 한나라당을 ‘뇌물당”이라 부른 후 사과를 거부해 국회를 한달 가까이 공전케 했다. 최근에는 서울대 강연에서 대학원생들에게 대통령의 사람들은 부패와 권력남용을 “멀리해야 한다”고 말해 여권 내에서 큰 분쟁을 일으켰다.하지만 많은 전문가들은 이 총리의 인기 상승을 일시적인 현상으로 보고 있다.“비록 이 총리가 면밀하고 능란한 행정가이긴 하지만 유능한 대통령 후보로는 국민적 인지도가 너무 약하다”고 윤영오 국민대 교수가 말했다. “행정관료와 정치인 사이에는 분명한 차이가 있으며 이 총리는 리더로서의 성격이나 특징이 없다.”  김일영 성균관대 교수도 이에 동의했다.“노 대통령은 다른 어떤 대통령보다 더 많은 권한을 총리에게 위임했다”고 그는 말했다. “하지만 지금까지 이 총리는 대선 경쟁의 선두주자로서 자신을 내세울 수 있는 능력을 입증할만한 확실한 업적을 보이지 않았다.”  김 교수는 이 총리의 독설도 차기 대선의 준비를 도울 정치적 원군을 만드는 데 방해가 된다고 덧붙였다. “이 총리가 원군을 찾는 데도 어려움이 있는데 하물며 어떻게 국가를 이끌 수 있겠는가?”라고 김 교수는 반문했다.하지만 당내 관계자들은 이 총리와 그를 둘러싼 상황을 유심히 지켜보고 있다.그들은 이 총리가 청년층에서 인기가 높다는 점을 국면을 전환시킬 수 있는 주요 요인으로 보고 있다. 노 대통령이 2002년 대선에서 승리할 것으로 전망한 전문가는 많지 않았지만 젊은 세대의 압도적인 지지가 그를 대통령으로 만들었다. 따라서 이 총리가 강력한 개혁 이미지로 젊은 세대 사이에서 인기를 유지한다면 차기 대통령으로 당선될 가능성이 있을 것으로 그들은 전망했다.작년 6월 고건 전 총리 후임으로 취임한 이 총리는 대통령의 전폭적인 지원 하에 국정 운영에 있어 중요한 역할을 해왔다. 이 총리에 대한 노 대통령의 신임은 국정 현안을 다룸에 있어서의 개방성과 사안을 신속히 해결하는 추진력과 더불어 과거 민주 투사로서의 경력 등에서 나오고 있다.정 장관과 김 장관 등 경쟁자들과 비교할 때 이 총리는 노 대통령의 오른팔로서 대통령과 긴밀히 접촉할 수 있는 데 이는 이점임에 분명하다. 그러나 정권 투쟁을 극도로 싫어하는 젊은 세대의 지지에도 불구하고 총리직에만 전념하고 있는 이 총리는 대권 후보자들이 벌이는 권력 싸움에 관여하지 않는 입장을 보여 왔다.게다가 일부 열린우리당 개혁파 의원들은 이 총리 지지 움직임을 강화하고 있다.4월 전당대회에서 온건 노선의 문희상 의원이 의장으로 선출됨에 따라 당분간 우리당 내 실용주의 노선이 개혁과 실용주의를 둘러싼 오랜 논쟁에서 우세를 보일 것으로 보인다.정 장관은 4월 전당대회 이후 문 의장과 실용주의 진영을 공개적으로 지지해 온 반면 김 장관은 정도는 크게 약하지만 개혁 진영을 지지하고 있다.우리당에 대한 김 장관의 지지 약화와 그의 지지도 하락 와중에 우리당 내 개혁파 진영은 그 대신에 진보성향의 이 총리에게 다가가려는 조짐을 보이고 있다.김 장관에 비해 개혁 성향이 확실히 더 강한 이 총리는 개혁 성향이 강한 유시민 의원과 긴밀한 접촉을 계속하면서 이 총리와 개혁파가 연대를 모색하고 있다는 견해를 뒷받침하고 있다.그러나 보수적인 정치 전문가들은 그러한 말이 단순한 추측에 불과하다고 일축하고 있다.“이 총리는 개혁파 진영이 차기 대권주자로 내세울 강력한 후보가 여전이 아니다”라고 한국정치연구소 정창인 정치 평론가는 말했다.“다수의 젊은 우리당 개혁파 의원들에게 있어 이 총리는 여전히 김대중 전 대통령 시절에도 활동한 구시대 정치인으로 간주되고 있는 데 이는 이들간 연대에 주요 걸림돌이 될 것이다.”  53세의 이 총리는 36세의 나이에 정계에 입문했다. 5선 의원인 이 총리는 98년 교육부 장관을 지내는 등 김대중 정부의 핵심 인물이었다.2002년 이 총리는 당시 노 후보의 선거위원회를 이끌었다.날카로운 예지력과 논리를 갖춘 탁월한 행정가로서 칭찬받고는 있지만 많은 이들은 이 총리에 관해 대중적 친밀성을 결여한 관계로 대통령의 오른팔로서 그를 보고 있다. 야당 의원들은 종종 그를 두고 “능력은 뛰어나지만 미덕은 갖추지 못한 인물”로 비난하고 있다."
GNP feuds over ‘conservative’ label,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000116767?sid=104,"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 18:36:00 +0900","			 Leadership claims the term has negative connotations for young voters The ruling Grand National Party, already struggling with vote-buying allegations, is facing internal feuding over whether to eliminate the term “conservatism” from the party platform.Though the party’s emergency leadership council largely agreed the term delivered a negative image to voters, the proposal to remove it triggered backlash from most GNP lawmakers who regard it as a key right-wing value.The council’s subcommittee on policy reforms is said to have drafted a revised party platform, with the term “conservatism” deleted.“We took out the expression ‘conservatism’ from our revised platform draft, but kept alive such conservative values as ‘free nation,’ ‘market economy’ and ‘national security,’” a member of the subcommittee told a local news agency on Wednesday.As the news about the draft circulated, some GNP lawmakers who regard conservatism as the GNP identity expressed a strong opposition to the move in meetings with reporters. The head of the subcommittee tried to calm the stir by denying reports that it may send the draft to the council for further discussion.“I have not received any notice of the kind and the issue is not to be discussed in today’s meeting,” said Rep. Kwon Young-jin, joint chairman of the subcommittee.Kim Chong-in, former presidential secretary and leading member of the decision-making council, strongly pushed for the deletion.“It is up to the voters to judge whether a party is or is not conservative,” said Kim.“We do not need to state it in the party platform, especially as the word delivers an adverse image to the young generation.” Politics nowadays may no longer be seen as just conservative and progressive, he added.That view was met with fierce opposition from most of the party’s influential members.“The GNP has advocated conservative values throughout its long history,” said Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan, a close aide to council chairwoman Rep. Park Geun-hye.“The elimination of the word should thus be approved by members of the party.” Rep. Chung Doo-un, a leading reformer, also spoke against the change.“People should make efforts to change themselves, instead of rearranging the words in the party’s doctrine,” he said.Chung, who is also the head of the party’s policy think tank, earlier said that the GNP should disband itself and start anew as a true conservative party.While the council and party lawmakers clashed over fundamental values, interim leader Rep. Park left the parliament Wednesday to pay a visit to livestock farms in Gangwon Province, meeting with farmers and local residents.Cattle farmers recently suffered heavy losses due to a price slump, with some staging protests to call for the government to purchase their beef cows for price stabilization.Political observers see Park’s visit to farmers as a signal that she intends to shift the weight of the party renewal back to the people’s livelihoods. The GNP has come under fire for neglecting voters’ lives to focus on partisan interests.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldm.com)"
Europe`s unity in European values,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000046396?sid=108,"Wed, 15 Sep 2004 10:02:00 +0900","			   Alongside the debate about the European Union`s constitution, a discussion about European values has also developed. This is important not only for implanting meaning into the constitution, but will also determine the vitality and energy of the EU itself.The EU, being the product of several great religious and philosophical traditions, is a community of values. The ideas of the Greeks and Romans, Christianity, Judaism, humanism, and the Enlightenment have made us who we are. Dialogue with Islamic and Arabic cultures also helped form our identity. The pattern of our values has been woven over hundreds of years.Europe is the continent of Michelangelo and Montesquieu, but also of the guillotine and the gas chamber. Indeed, the bitter experience of World War II taught Europeans the importance of shared values. In an impoverished, war-ravaged Europe, people yearned for peace, freedom, stability, and a new chance to prosper.The architects of European integration - Monnet, Schuman, Adenauer, De Gasperi, and others - understood that these ideals could be achieved only by combining and interweaving the practical interests of Europe`s countries. They built their fragile house of peace on a foundation of coal and steel.The founders passed the torch on to the generation of Jacques Delors, Helmut Kohl, Francois Mitterrand, Vaclav Havel, Valery Giscard d`Estaing, and others. They broadened and deepened European cooperation. Their leadership made it possible for Europe to make great strides towards its post-war ideals - peace, stability, and prosperity.We now stand at the threshold of a new phase of European cooperation. In late October, the EU`s Constitutional Treaty will be signed. A new generation of politicians is ready to carry the torch onwards.But is the torch still burning bright? In the early 1950s, Jean Monnet wrote: ""We are not forming a coalition of states. We are uniting people."" Apparently not. As the EU races ahead, it seems that it has lost Europe`s citizens along the way. Many are turning their backs on the whole project. They have trouble seeing what is common to Europe. They do not feel part of the great whole. Even in the new member states, enthusiasm for the European family of democracies is cooling. We have achieved a united Europe without uniting Europeans.Today`s post-war generations, lacking direct memory of WWII, view Europe`s great achievements - liberty, peace, and prosperity - as a given. The idea of Europe as a heritage and a mission does not mean much. But, without ideals, Europe`s foundations will erode.The emphasis on pure self-interest increases this threat. My generation grew up with the image of Europe as an economic form of cooperation. Political motives behind European integration were overshadowed by the economic project. The result is an impression of Europe as a marketplace. A Europe of markets and money, not of man and morals, dominated the project. But without a moral foundation, there can be no free-market economy.Today, we are paying the price for not attending to Europe`s shared values and common mission. Until Europeans know precisely what Europe stands for, what inspires and motivates us, the EU will not be able to take joint action in the world.The EU Constitution will make Europe more democratic and more transparent. It provides further guarantees that decisions will be taken by those closest to citizens, and it acknowledges the significance the values on which the EU rests: respect for human rights and dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, and the rule of law. These shared values are the glue that binds governments together in the recognition that clinging to pure self-interest is no longer reasonable when common concerns call for a common strategy.For what is the point of doing away with Europe`s physical borders if borders between its citizens remain? How can Europeans be happy that the Iron Curtain is gone if individuals and groups across the EU barricade themselves behind private iron curtains? Indeed, fear, insecurity, and nationalism are again raising their heads. It is important for Europeans to reflect on that as they prepare for further rounds of enlargement and consider starting accession negotiations with Turkey.The preamble of the Constitution states that Europe is ""united in its diversity."" This may be the most concise statement of what makes Europe Europe. But the words ""united in diversity"" raise the question of where this unity lies.The answer lies in the values on which the EU is based. They are contained in three concepts: freedom, solidarity, and mutual respect. These three together make it possible for Europe to open its doors to a great diversity of peoples and at the same time to speak as a community of peoples prepared to take responsibility for one another.Making such a community a reality will not come about by believing that Europe`s culture is better than others. We will make it a reality through dialogue and deep reflection about Europe`s common values. Values must be the road that leads to what cannot be reached by markets and institutions alone - the accession of Europe`s citizens to the European Union.Only by embracing their shared values can Europeans prevent the EU from becoming a spiritless machine. Together, Europeans must find what connects them, and derive new enthusiasm, new spirit from what they find - a spirit sorely needed to tackle the great issues of today. No country can address these issues along. After more than 50 years, Europe as a community of values remains as necessary as ever.Dr. Jan Peter Balkenende is prime minister of the Netherlands and president of the European Council. - Ed.Copyright: Project Syndicate   By Jan Peter Balkenende    "
Exhibit focuses on 120-year history of Korean photography,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000008148,"Wed, 16 Dec 1998 00:00:00 +0900","			By Edward Kim Staff reporter With the ""Year of Photography"" coming to a close, a large-scale exhibition that took 5 years of preparation is presenting a retrospective look at over a century of Korean photography. Occupying three exhibition rooms at the Seoul Arts Center's Art Gallery, ""History of Korean Photography"" covers 120 years in the development of photography here as well as captures major events in Korean history starting from the late Choson Period to the present. Running through Saturday, the show is supported by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as part of this year's designated cultural theme. It was put together by the History of Photography Research Institute which has been collecting and documenting photos for the past 30 years. ""We tried to maintain a sincere attitude towards history by presenting and preserving photos from each generation in their original form. History and all its events can be seen in the photos,"" said the institute. Black-and-whites as well as antique photos taken with old- fashioned box cameras highlight the show. Many of the pictures are on display for the first time. Newspaper photos are kept in original newsprint form without any enlargements adding a feeling of authenticity to the show. With the next century designated as an image-oriented generation, photography will play a large part in the daily lives of people as an easy-to-do form of art, hobby, entertainment and medium of mass communication, says the institute. Accordingly, the exhibition is divided into three sections of various themes and two special exhibits to emphasize the intimacy of photography with society, show the development of it here from a historic perspective and set up new conceptions of the popular medium. ""The Past (1860-1950)"" starts with the introduction of photography to Korea in 1860 during the late Choson Period. It expands to cover the last days of the Choson Kingdom and fight against Japanese imperialism to the start of the fratricidal Korean War. The determined expression of famous freedom fighter Yu Kwan-soon in a 1919 mugshot poignantly captures the bitter struggle against brutal Japanese colonialism. She died in the infamous Seodaemun Prison along with many other opponents of Japanese oppression. ""The Present (1950-1990)"" covers from the Korean War to the present. The tired but happy faces of miners and other laborers during Korea's rapid industrialization period reminds viewers of the sweat and toil that went into modernizing Korea. Photos of Korean society during and after the war reveal the hardship and loss experienced by the older generation. Portrait pictures of celebrities and influential people like actor-turned-National Assembly member Shin Young-kyun are also included in this section as well as chilling photos of the 1980 Kwangju Massacre where soldiers killed over 200 civilian protestors. The last section exhibits important events in the history of Korean photography and photo magazines, postcards, cameras used by famous photographers and other publications to help viewers understand Korean photographers. Showing the future trend of Korean photography, the first special exhibition displays some 200 works taken after 1980 by 25 influential contemporary photographers as well as pioneers in the field. The second displays cameras and other paraphernalia used in photography from France's National Camera Museum, including the first commercial camera invented by Daguerre as well as 20 pictures taken with the camera. Photo restoration technology is also demonstrated. The exhibition shows the future of photography by presenting its past. The show not only promotes recognition and development of photography but also shows its uses as an art genre. Artistic nude photos in ""The Present"" section reveals the versatility of photography. Tickets are priced at 5,000 won for general admission and 3,000 won for students. For more information, call 730-5805."

MDP split over readmission of politicians,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000040457?sid=108,"Sat, 03 Jan 2004 11:30:00 +0900","			Disputes are emerging within the ranks of the former ruling Millennium Democratic Party over its readmission of politicians who abandoned the party during the 2002 presidential election.Younger members of the MDP began to show dissatisfaction toward the leadership`s choice to readmit such politicians as Rep. Ahn Dong-seon of the United Liberal Democrats and Shin Nak-kyun, leader of the National Alliance 21, a non-parliamentary group formerly headed by Rep. Chung Mong-joon. Both had left the MDP to join the rival political groups during the last presidential election race.The party is also pushing to recruit veteran six-term lawmaker Rep. Lee Han-dong of the minor political group Hanaro National Union.""Ahn and Shin will be declaring their entry into the MDP sometime next week and Lee seems to have made up his mind to join (the MDP),"" said Rep. Kim Kyung-jae, member of the standing central committee.Junn Sung-chull, former chief policymaker of the National Alliance 21 and former MDP member, was also reported to rejoin the party early next week.Arguing that the MDP ""cannot afford to go back to its conservative image,"" the younger generation criticized the leadership for contradicting its strategy to bring in fresh faces to compete against the reform-driven Uri Party.""The MDP must seek for rational reformation, not degenerative conservatism. The party will lose its image of principle-driven and anti-corruption if it brings back all the politicians who moved between parties like migratory birds,"" said Chang Sung-min, head of the youth committee.The leadership led by Chairman Rep. Chough Soon-hyung countered that it was necessary to have various types of political power in the party for the sake of broadening the support base ahead of April 15 general elections.Political watchers said the dispute over the recruitment and readmission would likely spread to which political color the party would adopt leading up to the crucial elections.By Lee Joo-hee (angiely@heraldm.com)   "

Hyundai Motor Company Introduces Second Generation Veloster,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/030/0002662533?sid=004,"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 09:01:00 +0900","			'Veloster', which is the major work for 'PYL (Premium Younique Lifestyle)' brand that was ambitiously pushed by Vice-Chairman Chung Eui-sun of Hyundai Motor Company, will go through a full change and will be available on markets in 2018 as second generation Veloster.PYL is a sub brand that was prepared in order to target young consumers who are in their 20s and 30s.  Although Veloster was seen as the most 'unique' model out of all Hyundai Motor Company's cars due to its distinct design, its sales volume did not meet Hyundai's expectations.Hyundai Motor Company focused all of its abilities and capabilities into second generation Veloster.  It established a task force under the project name JS and put in all of its technical skills.  By doing so, it was able to complete second generation Veloster within three years.New Veloster media preview event was held at Gwangwon Inje Speedium on the 28th for reporters who are responsible for making reports on cars.  It was an unprecedented event as this event introduced design of second generation Veloster and even performed trial rides even before new Veloster is officially released.""First generation Veloster had received great interests from the public due to its unique design."" said TFT Director Kim Young-heon who oversaw development of second generation Veloster.  ""Second generation Veloster enhances sense of immersion in driving as it adds sporty performance while maintaining its unique design.""Hyundai Motor Company maintained asymmetric doors, which are symbols of Veloster, for second generation Veloster as well.  Second generation Veloster also has an asymmetric door on driver side and '1+2' asymmetric doors on the front and the back of passenger side.  Hyundai Motor Company adjusted ratio of its car frame in order tom emphasize swift feel of Veloster.  It also made its hood longer and pushed back space for passengers to the back in order to give off an image of dynamic coupe.Rendering image of new Veloster Hyundai Motor Company fixed some of Veloster's inside parts that were seen as weaknesses of first generation Veloster.  It adjusted height of seats and increased head space for passengers after hearing that it is difficult to seat in the back of first generation Veloster due to low roof height.  It applied various high-tech specifications such as non-embeddable navigation and combiner HUD (Head Up Display).""Veloster is an icon for Hyundai Motor Company's challenges and innovations."" said Team Leader Koo Min-cheol who was in charge of second generation Veloster's design.  ""While maintaining identities of first generation Veloster, we focused on improving degree of completion of design through more sporty look.Hyundai Motor Company's development teams are confident that they have improved 'joy in driving' by a step higher.  Rather than increasing values of Veloster's specifications, they maximized drive performance that a driver can feel by focusing on enhancing balance of Veloster's frame.Its powertrain is composed of two engines such as kappa 1.4-liter gasoline turbo and gamma 1.6-liter gasoline turbo.  Hyundai Motor Company combined engine with 7-speed DCT (Double Clutch Transmission) and added 6-speed manual transmission to 1.6-liter gasoline turbo model for Veloster manias.""In case of 1.6-liter gasoline turbo model, we improved its engine so that it can produce its maximum torque around 1,500rpm and increased acceleration within low-speed regions."" said Senior Researcher Hwang Tae-won who was in charge of second generation Veloster's powertrain.  ""Owners of second generation Velosters will truly feel the joy of driving these cars as we also added a function that allows these cars to display power that surpass their maximum torque between 2,000 and 4,000rpm through over-boost control function.""Hyundai Motor Company still needs to set up marketing strategies and figure out which consumers they are going to target.  Hyundai Motor Company decided on 'millennial generations' that express themselves and pursue joys of life as its targets for second generation Veloster.  It explained that there are not any models that can directly compete with Veloster as it is a car that cannot be compared.On the other hand, new Veloster will be introduced officially at Detroit Motor Show that will be held in January of 2018.  Afterwards, it is going to start selling new Velosters starting with South Korean markets followed by global markets.Staff Reporter Jung, Chiyeon | chiyeon@etnews.com [Copyright ⓒ 전자신문 & 전자신문인터넷, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]"

(US-NK summit) (News Focus) NK leader-image shaping,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0010654921?sid=104,"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 09:15:00 +0900","(US-NK summit) (News Focus) N.K. leader eyes image as reliable economic leaderBy Song Sang-ho   SEOUL, Feb. 25 (Yonhap) -- Ahead of this week's summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un is hogging the global limelight, where he may seek to craft an image as a reliable leader for diplomatic and economic cooperation.   The Hanoi summit, set for Wednesday and Thursday, is expected to be another chance for Kim to carve out that image -- crucial for his push to ease Pyongyang's isolation, create diplomatic and business opportunities and rebuild its threadbare economy, analysts said Monday.   The second meeting with Trump is a culmination of the charm offensive that he launched early last year when he shifted his policy focus to the economy after he strengthened his hand with the declaration on the ""completion of the state nuclear force"" in November 2017.   ""In the first several years since taking power, Kim prioritized tightening his grip on power through repressive measures with little heed to how he would be viewed by the outside audience,"" said Kim Tae-hyeong, a professor of political science at Soongsil University.    ""Now stably ensconced on the North's throne, he apparently wants to show the world that he is a stable, normal interlocutor for diplomacy, while to the domestic audience, he is a modern, confident leader on the world stage,"" he added.This image, provided by Yonhap News TV, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. (Yonhap)Since taking over the reclusive state upon the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011, his public persona had been associated mostly with his reign of terror, marked by the brutal execution of dissenters and potential rivals, including his uncle Jang Song-thaek in 2013 -- not to mention the apparent assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in 2017.    His menacing rhetoric and saber-rattling against Seoul and Washington had raised fears of war and dampened hopes that the Swiss-educated young leader could reverse his country's provocative tack and move to lift it out of the economic doldrums.   But with crippling sanctions and deepening isolation, economic reality has been sinking in for the third-generation hereditary ruler keen on building his own legacy rather than riding on the coattails of his late grandfather and national founder Kim Il-sung and his father.   In 2016, Kim rolled out a five-year national development scheme. But it has gained little traction as political uncertainties and the international sanctions scared away foreign investors and dried up business opportunities.    Absent any tangible outcome from the scheme, the North's leader may likely lose face in a future party congress, likely in the early 2020s, where the ruling Workers' Party would take stock of his achievements over the past years, observers said.    ""Who would like to do business or cut any deal with a pariah state that the U.S. once labeled as an outpost of tyranny? Kim is obviously aware of the reality that his country's economy will not fare well with that opaque image,"" said Kim Tae-hyun, a diplomacy professor at Chung Ang University.   ""He appears to be scrambling to project himself as a leader of a 'normal' state in summits with world leaders where his wife Ri Sol-ju also tags along -- an image that he can also use to play to his own citizens to instill a sense of pride in them,"" he added.   Trump's repeated mentions of the North's potential to become a ""great economic powerhouse"" should it relinquish its nuclear arsenal might have added to his nascent efforts to position himself as an economic leader.   This week's summit is likely to focus on fleshing out Pyongyang's denuclearization steps in return for Washington's corresponding measures that may include economic -- or humanitarian -- incentives to advance Kim's bread-and-butter agenda.   His ongoing southward train trip for the summit in Hanoi via China was full of symbolism. It harked back to the famous ""Southern Tour"" by late former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who spearheaded China's economic reforms initiated in the late 1970s.   During the 1992 tour, Deng visited Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shanghai -- the provinces and cities that stood at the heart of his reform initiatives -- to double down on his drive for economic transformation amid growing skepticism.    Shoring up the debilitated economy remains the only unfinished part of Pyongyang's long-term, three-pronged vision to become an ""economically, ideologically and militarily strong"" nation. The North claims it has already become a powerful nation ideologically with its ideology of ""juche,"" or self-reliance, and militarily with the ""nuclear button"" on Kim's desk.    A positive leadership image is only a fraction of what the North needs for economic rehabilitation, analysts said.   ""In terms of projecting DPRK to the world in economic terms, very little is known right now to the international community about the investment opportunities and challenges, legal frameworks and intellectual property rights in the DPRK,"" said Shawn Ho, a security researcher at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. DPRK is the acronym for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.   ""More needs to be done by Chairman Kim to inform the world about why he sees his country as an attractive trading partner and investment destination,"" he added.   The venues for his summits with Trump also suggest his eagerness to shape his economic leadership image, analysts said.   Singapore, the host of the first Trump-Kim summit, is noted for its ""open state-led capitalism"" that has propelled the city-state into the ranks of Asia's wealthiest countries. Vietnam, the host of this week's summit, has emerged as a thriving economy through sweeping market liberalization reforms initiated in the late 1980s while retaining a single communist party system.   ""Kim might have agreed to the summit venues as he has been angling for a new economic model that will still allow for his continued party control (despite economic openness),"" Kim of Soongsil University said.   sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)"

Nissan’s 6th-generation Altima to hit Korea in July,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000210374?sid=104,"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:24:00 +0900","			Amid rebounding sedan sales in the South Korean market, Nissan Korea said it will launch a sixth-generation model of its bestselling midsized sedan, the Altima, here in July. According to the carmaker, the most distinctive aspect of the fully transformed Altima is its design.  Nissan’s all-new Altima (Nissan Korea)With a sportier, more dynamic exterior design, Nissan said it had equipped the latest Altima with its award-winning Nissan Vmotion 2.0 design. In 2017, the Nissan Vmotion 2.0 was recognized as the best concept car at the EyesOn Design Awards. Nissan’s signature V-motion grille got larger and lower for a strong but elegant image, the automaker said. The car’s 25-millimeter-wider body completes the Altima’s sharper look, it added. The all-new Altima’s engine has also undergone a transformation. Nissan has applied a 2.0 liter VC-turbo engine to its 2.0 Turbo version, which enables drivers to experience automatic multi-link angles depending on the pedal input or driving situation. This engine technology makes peak horsepower of 252 and maximum torque of 38.7 kilogram-meters.The latest model has also incorporated safety and driver assistance features and an improved infotainment system, such as a 360-degree car camera as well as park assist and collision avoidance systems.Three trim options are available -- 2.5 Smart, 2.5 Tech and 2.0 Turbo -- and the price ranges from 20 million to 40 million won ($16,870 to $33,740), the automaker said.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
Samsung Electronics Announces Second Quarter 2021 Results,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002107794?sid=105,"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 15:49:00 +0900","- Sales of KRW 63.67 trillion is record for second quarter, operating profit at KRW 12.57 trillion Favorable market conditions expected for components business in second half   Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, July 29, 2021- Samsung Electronics today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021.   Total consolidated revenue was KRW 63.67 trillion, a 20% increase from the previous year and a record for the second quarter. Operating profit increased 34% from the previous quarter to KRW 12.57 trillion as market conditions improved in the memory market, operations normalized at the Austin foundry fab, and as effective global supply chain management (SCM) helped maintain solid profitability for the finished product businesses.   The Semiconductor business saw a significant improvement in earnings as memory shipments exceeded previous guidance and price increases were higher than expected, while the Company strengthened its cost competiveness. For the Display Panel Business, a one-off gain and an increase in overall prices boosted profits.   Earnings at the Mobile Communications Business declined from the previous quarter due to component supply shortages and COVID-19 related production disruptions. But the business posted solid profitability as the Company leveraged its global SCM capabilities, improved the cost structure and as contributions from tablets and wearables continued.   The Consumer Electronics Division posted strong results driven by increased sales of premium products as demand remained strong.   For the second half, market conditions are expected to be favorable for the component business and the Company will focus on enhancing product and technology leadership. In smartphones and consumer electronics, the Company aims to maintain solid profitability by strengthening the premium category leadership. However, risks of continued disruptions in component supply and uncertainties related to COVID-19 are likely to persist.   The Memory Business is expected to see continued demand growth for server and mobile products and the Company will accelerate migration to 15-nm DRAM and 6th-generation V-NAND as well as expand the application of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography process in DRAM production. Demand for key System LSI products is expected to increase as new smartphones are introduced, while the Foundry Business will accelerate growth by expanding the Pyeongtaek S5 Line capacity and by adjusting pricing to enable future investment cycles.   For the Display Panel Business, the mobile panel segment is expected to improve as major customers launch new flagship models and the Company will focus on finalizing the mass production process for quantum-dot (QD) displays for shipment to begin within the year.   The Mobile Communications Business plans to achieve solid revenue and profit by boosting the competitiveness of the product lineup with the launch of new foldable models and the expansion of mass market 5G phones. The Company will also continue to increase sales of the Galaxy Ecosystem products. The Networks Business will drive revenue growth in key markets, including North America, and continue to explore new opportunities in Europe and other regions.   The Consumer Electronics Division will solidify leadership in the premium TV market and increase digital appliances revenue by bolstering global sales of the Bespoke product line.  The Company’s capital expenditures in the second quarter reached KRW 13.6 trillion, including KRW 12.5 trillion spent on semiconductors and KRW 0.6 trillion on displays. Total capital expenditures in the first half were KRW 23.3 trillion, including KRW 20.9 trillion for semiconductors and KRW 1.4 trillion for displays. Investment in the Memory Business was spent mainly on addressing future demand through capacity expansion and process migrations to advanced nodes. Investment in the Foundry Business focused on expansion for advanced processes such as 5-nm EUV lithography.   The semiconductor business posted KRW 22.74 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 6.93 trillion in operating profit in the second quarter.   The Memory Business reported a significant increase in earnings from the previous quarter, led by strong demand for server and PC memory, as well as stronger-than-expected increases in average sales prices for both DRAM and NAND chips. Cost reduction from the ongoing adoption of latest manufacturing process also helped.   For DRAM, demand from datacenter companies was strong thanks to solid growth in Cloud service while continued trend for remote work and education lifted demand for PCs.   Demand for mobile memory, however, saw a limited impact in the short term due to recurring waves of COVID-19 outbreaks at locations of global smartphone production bases and tight supplies of key components.   The graphics market also grew in the second quarter on healthy demand for cryptocurrency and graphic cards for gaming PCs. Memory demand for game consoles also grew on new game launches, against the backdrop of rising need for home entertainment.   Samsung was able to respond promptly to the strong server and PC demand, reporting a higher bit growth than the previous guidance, thanks to a preemptive adjustment to the Company’s production mix.   As for NAND, demand was solid over sustained growth in content-per-box, particularly from major customers, even as tight supplies of components limited overall mobile phone production in the second quarter. Solid state drives (SSDs) reported growth due to increased investment in servers from datacenter companies and solid demand for laptops.   NAND shipments in the quarter also exceeded the previous bit growth guidance while the portion of 128-layer 6th-generation V-NAND continued to increase.   Looking to the second half of the year, the market is expected to see supply problems for components persist, as well as risks from the variant COVID-19 viruses and geopolitical tensions. However, the memory market’s fundamentals remain strong on the back of increasing 5G adoption and sustained demand for servers and PCs.   Memory demand will likely be buoyed by new smartphone model launches, with the wider 5G availability driving growth in content-per-box. Increasing adoption of the latest CPU, along with growing enterprise PC demand to support the new remote work dynamics, is expected to support memory demand for servers and PCs. At the same time, Samsung’s chip inventory level has fallen to a substantially low level due to the stronger shipment last quarter than the previous guidance.   Samsung will continue to manage production mix in a flexible manner and enhance capabilities to meet fluctuating market demand. The Company will further cement its leadership in cutting-edge chip technology and is set to begin mass production of 14-nm DRAM using the EUV-based process, based on the industry’s smallest design rule in the 14-nm class, in the second half. Samsung will also start mass production of consumer SSD adopting the double-stack based 176-layer 7th generation V-NAND, using the finest etching technology, during the second half.   The System LSI Business saw its earnings improve in the second quarter with a solid demand for 100 Mp image sensors from Chinese customers and as production normalized at the Austin fab. However, improvement was somewhat limited due to a decrease in flagship smartphone launches and SoC demand amid weak seasonality.    The Company also released an image sensor that applies 0.64μm ISOCELL, which is the smallest pixel size in the industry, and also the Company’s first product of the image sensor for automotive and expanded its business areas by releasing 3 types of PMICs for DDR5 DRAM modules.   In the second half of the year, especially third quarter, the overall earnings is expected to improve amid rising demand for SoC and OLED DDI as we enter strong seasonality for smartphones and TVs.   The Foundry Business saw its earnings improve thanks to early normalization of the Austin fab and maximized chip supply capabilities.   In the second half of this year, the Company expects to see a continued 5G penetration, work-from-home trend, and customers securing safety stock resulting in higher market growth than before.   To meet this rising demand, the Company will maximize its capabilities to supply chips via full-fledged operation of Pyeongtaek S5 Line, and target annual sales growth of well over 20% through pricing strategies to sustain future investment as well as customer and application diversification.   The Display Panel Business posted KRW 6.87 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.28 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter. Its earnings improved from the previous quarter despite weak seasonality for mobile products, primarily due to a one-time gain as well as an increase in overall ASP.   Mobile display saw its earnings grow as the continued adoption of OLED panels by customers helped its profit margin remain strong. Compared to a year earlier, both sales and operating profit increased substantially because of wider adoption of OLED displays as well as the base effect. For large displays, while the conversion of manufacturing lines to QD displays affected revenues, profitability improved thanks to the increased ASP of panels for TVs and monitors.     Looking ahead to the second half, Samsung expects demand to recover for mobile displays as major customers are planning to launch new flagship models, including high-value products such as foldable phones. However, there are concerns that a supply crunch of certain components such as DDIs may affect shipments for some customers. Meanwhile, the Company forecasts the sales of IT devices and portable gaming products featuring OLED screens to grow in earnest.    Samsung will continue to strengthen its market leadership by introducing new technologies such as Under Panel Camera (UPC) and low-power consumption related one. For large displays, the Company will focus on finalizing the mass production process for QD display to allow product shipments to start within the year.   The IT & Mobile Communications Division posted KRW 22.67 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.24 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.    Overall market demand decreased from the previous quarter due to the impact of weak seasonality and prolonging COVID-19. The Mobile Communications Business saw revenue decrease compared to the previous quarter, influenced by a component supply shortage in the industry as well as production disruptions in its Vietnam factory. However, the Company secured solid double-digit operating profit margin by minimizing impact through rebalancing supply with its global SCM capabilities and improving cost structure. Device Ecosystem products such as tablet, wearables also contributed to the second quarter profit.   Looking ahead to the second half, mobile market is forecast to recover to the pre-COVID level on an annual basis as 5G adoption and contactless trend continue to thrive. However, uncertainties over component supply and COVID-19 will continue to persist. The Company will strive to achieve solid revenue and profits by enhancing the competitiveness of its smartphone lineup with the launch of new foldable models and expansion of mass-market 5G models. Also, it will further increase sales of the Galaxy Ecosystem products.   With successful launch of the new foldable smartphones with further enhanced user experience, the Company will solidify its leadership in the premium segment by mainstreaming the foldable category while continuing the sales momentum of Galaxy S series throughout the year.   As for the Networks Business, the Company improved performance compared to the previous quarter backed by growth of its North America business and 5G networks expansion in South Korea. The Company will strive to drive sales growth in North America and Japan while exploring new business opportunities in Europe and other markets.   The Consumer Electronics Division, comprised of the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses, recorded KRW 13.4 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.06 trillion in operating profit in the second quarter.    Overall market demand for TVs decreased from the previous quarter due to low seasonality, but was higher compared to a year earlier. Expanded sales of premium products including the newly launched Neo QLED, and a timely response, based on operational efficiency, to demand generated by global sporting events allowed the Company to post solid profits in the second quarter.    The Digital Appliances Business also posted steady results, buoyed by sustained pent-up demand in the quarter. The Company launched its Bespoke lineup in global markets in May, garnering positive initial feedback from the market. New lifestyle products including the Shoe Dresser and cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner also led to expanded sales.    Looking ahead to the second half, COVID-19 related uncertainties continue to pose a risk for both TV and Digital Appliances businesses. However, the Company looks forward to improved demand for TVs compared to the first half of the year, due to stronger seasonality.   The Company will closely monitor rapidly changing market conditions, and swiftly respond to changes in demand with its advanced SCM capabilities. Expanded sales of premium products via peak-season promotions tailored by region, enhanced online and offline buying experiences, and improved operational efficiency are part of the plan to secure profitability.

Both the group’s debut track, “Like OOH-AHH,” and its sophomore single, “Cheer Up” dominated local music charts for weeks. Comprising a multiethnic bunch of girls, including Japanese members Momo and Sana and Taiwanese Tzuyu, Twice has been reaching a broad international audience. The group’s recent album “Page Two” topped iTunes charts in seven countries, while its music video for “Like OOH-AHH” boasts over 60 million views on YouTube.In promoting K-pop, social media is more efficient and influential than traditional media nowadays, industry insiders say. EXID, for example, gained massive popularity in 2014 when a fan uploaded online a video clip, dubbed “fancam,” of member Hani dancing onstage -- two years after the group had made its television debut.“There’s no need for costly promotions anymore,” said Jung Won-jung, an official at public relations agency I-je Company. Jung is in charge of public relations for girl group Mamamoo, which has accrued a significant following for its powerful vocals and funk-influenced music style, mostly through social media. “For example, when Chloe Moretz was in Korea, she said in interviews that she became a fan of Mamamoo’s song ‘Taller than You’ after seeing the music video online,” said Jung, referring to the Hollywood actress. International fans are going one step further than simply watching their favorite K-pop stars’ videos online -- they upload “reaction” videos, creating new content sprung from the stars’ performances. Girl group Lovelyz poses in a garden clad in white costumes. (Woollim Entertainment)One popular “reactor” online is Michael Johnson, who uploads commentaries on K-pop songs on his YouTube handle, MRJKPOP. Followed by over 70,000 people and himself a musician, Johnson takes each new K-pop release and offers his analysis of various aspects of the new song, from the production quality to the “concept,” or theme of the song. Johnson, who picks Taeyeon of Girls’ Generation as his “bias” -- a term used among global K-pop fans to refer to their favorite member in a group -- said he first got into K-pop through an LG phone commercial that featured the song “Chocolate Love,” sung by Girls’ Generation and f(x).“At first. ... I had no idea who they were, and six or eight months later, I was just browsing around YouTube and I accidentally found some f(x) music. ... That was kind of my window into K-pop,” he said in a video on his channel.  Girl groups that are ‘girls’One prominent trend among the new generation of emerging girl groups is an emphasis on a more “innocent” and less provocative image. Groups like GFriend, Lovelyz, CLC and LABOUM, which all debuted between 2014 and 2015, wear schoolgirl uniforms and sing sprightly tunes about puppy love. A blog titled “Unpopular K-pop Opinions,” which receives anonymous submissions from K-pop fans around the world, talks about how GFriend’s “power innocence” concept is a refreshing change of pace. “I’m very glad that groups like GFriend are drawing attention with their cute concept,” said one post. “I do not want their agency to force these young girls to go to a sexy desperate concept.” “The ‘sexy’ concept has become saturated in the hallyu idol market,” said an official at Plan A Entertainment, home to the girl group Apink. When Apink first debuted with the song “I Don’t Know” in 2011, the group stood out in a sea of powerful dance routines and revealing costumes.“Their sweet and bright image satisfied an unfulfilled demand,” said the official.A generation gone byIn 2007, Wonder Girls kicked off what has come to be heralded as the “second generation” of K-pop girl groups with its catchy hook song, “Tell Me” and a highly imitable dance routine to match. Prior to the group’s debut, there had been a dearth in girl groups in the K-pop scene since the late 1990s, when groups like S.E.S, Fin.K.L. and Baby V.O.X. -- regarded as the first generation of Korea’s girl groups -- were active. The early 2000s were colored by R&B girl groups like Big Mama, SeeYa and Brown Eyed Girls, which focused more on strong vocal techniques over dance and visual presentations.Wonder Girls’ massive hit was followed by a flood of girl groups -- Girls’ Generation, After School, 2NE1, 4Minute, T-ara, Secret, f(x) and Rainbow, all of whom debuted between 2007 and 2009.The six members of GFriend are featured on a shot for the group’s latest single “Rough.” (Source Entertainment)Recently, however, Wonder Girls has been stuck in a prolonged hiatus since its main vocalist and leader Sunye got married in 2012 and member Sohee left JYP Entertainment in 2013 to pursue an acting career. In 2011, girl group Kara announced that it was leaving its agency DSP Entertainment. In 2012, T-ara’s Hwa-young left the group amid allegations that she had been mistreated by her teammates.  Other groups have also been on shaky ground since the passing of their heyday. After School, which switches its members every so often through a “matriculation” and “graduation” system, has not released an album since 2014.  2NE1’s activities came to a halt in 2014 when its lead vocalist Park Bom was charged with, but not indicted for, having banned drugs sent from the U.S. to Korea. Last month, the group’s agency YG Entertainment announced that it had parted ways with Gong Minzy.In 2015, Sulli left girl group f(x) to focus on her acting career. More recently, JYP Entertainment announced it will not be renewing its contract with Jia of Miss A, leaving many to question the group’s future.“When certain members of a group become more sought-after in the industry, it’s difficult for the group to exist as a whole,” said an entertainment industry official who asked to be unnamed. “Typically, the life span of girl groups averages around seven years.”By Rumy Doo (doo@heraldcorp.com)This is the 14th article in a series that explores the driving forces behind hallyu and the global rise of Korean pop culture. -- Ed.Korea, Japan, U.S. to hold missile defense drillJung Kyung-ho, SNSD’s Sooyoung spotted on a theater date			[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] [주니어헤럴드]구독신청 1588-0533<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>"
[Behind the Wheel] 8th-generation Sonata sets standard for smart mobilit...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000208813?sid=104,"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:09:00 +0900","			Hyundai Motor’s eighth-generation all-new Sonata -- the vehicle’s first new version in five years -- has changed seemingly everything about the car except the name. It has undergone some drastic design changes, featuring hidden lighting and a coupe-like frame for the first time. It has adopted a sloping roofline and low deck lid to make the body look longer. The company said the new Sonata’s design, dubbed “Sensuous Sportiness,” was inspired by last year’s Le Fil Rouge concept that was first unveiled during the Geneva Motor Show.                                                          Hyundai Motor’s new Sonata on the road (Hyundai Motor)               Breaking the steady-selling sedan’s conventional image, the new Sonata’s interior has been changed to offer a high-tech, premium feel in the front seat with a wide dashboard and buttons that are intuitive to use. Drivers can also use a smartphone-based digital key by downloading a mobile app to unlock and start the vehicle. The key can be shared between several people. The power train has also been completely overhauled.For all four trim levels -- Gasoline 2.0, LPI 2.0, Gasoline 1.6 Turbo and Hybrid -- Hyundai said it has adopted the new engine called Smart stream, to enhance fuel efficiency. The Gasoline 2.0 model runs on the G2.0 CVVL engine, tuned to deliver 160 horsepower and 20 kilogram-force meters of torque. It has increased fuel efficiency about 10.8 percent from the previous model. During a test drive through Gyeonggi Province, along a 75-kilometer route from Ilsan to Namyangju, the ride was very smooth on the road, but when the car picked up speed on the highway wind and road noise seeped into the cabin. The new Sonata shifts gears electronically at the push of buttons well placed and easy to use, and also free up console space compared to the traditional gear lever. Some safety features also stood out, such as a built-in camera that covers blind spots at the front and the rear of the car, allowing the driver to check lanes more easily. The price begins from 23.4 million won ($20,600) and goes up to 32.8 million won for the highest trim for gasoline model. Sales began on March 21. By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)The Korea Herald ratingsDesign: 4 stars Fuel economy: 4 starsSafety: 4 starsPrice: 5 StarsOverall: 17/20[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"

"Hyundai Motor Company’s 2nd Generation FCEV Can Be Purchased for $33,60...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/030/0002627349?sid=004,"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 08:54:00 +0900","			Hyundai Motor Company has set price of 2nd generation FCEV (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle), which will be introduced next month, at $62,712 (70 million KRW).  However one will be able to purchase it at $33,596 (37.5 million KRW) by receiving national subsidy from South Korean Government.  This 2nd generation FCEV can drive for about 550km with just single charge and it is the first South Korean car to have wireless automatic parking system.  It is seen as a car that is more advanced in many aspects such as semi-self-driving technology, driving performance, and competitive edge in production cost than Toyota's Mirai, which is its only competition so far.According to industries on the 24th, Hyundai Motor Company is going to introduce 2nd generation FCEV globally next month.It is likely that Hyundai Motor Company will start selling 2nd generation FCEV in early 2018 when 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics is going to be held.  Hyundai Motor Company has set price of 2nd generation FCEV at $62,712 (70 million KRW).  However one will be able to purchase it at $33,596 (37.5 million KRW) by receiving national subsidy for FCEV ($24,637 (27.5 million KRW)) and subsidy from local government body (between $4,032 and $4,479 (4.5 million KRW and 5 million KRW)).  This 2nd generation FCEV's mileage and performance have been improved and its price is 20% lower than Hyundai Motor Company's 1st generation fuel cell vehicle called 'Tucson ix ($76,150 (85 million KRW))'.Mileage and performance of variety of electronic safety devices boast a world-class level.  By developing MEA (Membrane Electrode Assembly) and metallic separator, which have the highest level of difficulty in technology out of FCEV's major technologies (MEA, separator, GDL (Gas Diffusion Layer)), there is a high chance that Hyundai Motor Company's competitive edge in price will slowly increase due to mass-production.Virtual image of Hyundai Motor Company’s 2nd generation FCEV that is expected to be introduced globally next monthElectronic safety devices such as ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant Systems) have also been improved greatly.  This model has ASCC (Advanced Smart Cruise Control), LKAS (Lane Keeping Assist System), HAD (Highway Driving Assist) that is combined with navigation information, and AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking).  It also has wireless automatic parking system and includes advanced technologies that are level 2 or above in standards for self-driving technologies.2nd generation FCEV can drive for about 550km (based on its self-test) with just single charge which is longer than Mirai's range at 502km (312 miles) that is officially approved by United States EPA (Environmental Protection Agency).  It has 100kW fuel cell stack and high-output (120kW) electric motor.  Capacity of its lithium-ion batter is about 2kWh.Although electric motor can be operated as electricity that is produced from hydrogen fuel cell goes through a lithium-ion battery, Hyundai Motor Company's 2nd generation FCEV is designed so that its motor can be operated without having electricity go through a battery which increases energy efficiency.This 2nd generation FCEV is made with Hyundai Motor Company's first FCEV platform.  Length of this car is 4,800mm which is similar to Santa Fe.  Its door handle is designed so that it remains hidden in order to reduce air resistance and pops out when a driver approaches with a Smart Key.  It has 19-inch tires (245,45R,19) from Hankook Tire.It is a five-seater car and has 7-inch dashboard and 12.3-inch display at the front of a car and in the middle of a car respectively.  Although its design is similar to a concept car that is introduced at Seoul Motor Show, which was held in March, it has large grille at the front of a car.  Exterior of this car is made with carbon fiber.""Because there is a high chance that national subsidy for FCEV will be maintained next year, it is likely that one will be able to purchase it for $33,596 (37.5 million KRW)."" said a representative of an industry.  ""Hyundai Motor Company's competitive edge in price will continue to go up in the future as it was able to internalize major technologies of FCEV and is able to mass-produce its own products in the future.""Staff Reporter Park, Taejoon | gaius@etnews.com  [Copyright ⓒ 전자신문 & 전자신문인터넷, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]"

Dia returns full of love with ‘Love Generation’,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000191476?sid=104,"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 11:15:00 +0900","(Yonhap)K-pop act Dia returned fully charged with powerful energy with its third EP “Love Generation.” Clad in black-and-white school uniforms, the group’s nine singers sparkled as they took to the stage at a media showcase for their new EP in Seoul on Tuesday. Dia is short for “Diamond.”“Love Generation” marks Dia’s first release since its second full-length album “YOLO” four months ago. The EP delves into the feelings of a teenage girl dabbling in love. Each track features a different musical style ranging from dance pop to tropical house, but they all come down to one subject -- love.Based on the concept of school girls, the lead track “Can’t Stop” depicts the fluctuating emotions of teenagers as they start to develop innocent but unstable feelings for love interests they meet in school.“We tried to show those girls’ honest feelings and confident selves through the song,” band member Huihyeon said.Sporting a short haircut, Jenny said the group had focused on changing their appearances for the new release, such as by trying out different hairstyles. Yebin, who had gotten her hair cut extra short and dyed it blond, said, “I tried to lose weight to have a body figure that could go well with my new hairstyle. But I tried not to harm my health.”  DIA will promote its latest EP in two subunits BCHCS and L.U.B. BCHCS consists of Yebin, Chaeyeon, Eunice and Somyi, while L.U.B features Jueun, Jenny, Eunjin and Eunchae. “Look” and “Darling My Sugar,” the lead tracks of BCHCS and L.U.B., respectively, are also included in the 11-track EP. (Yonhap)“As we always tried to show different sides of ourselves through our previous work, we would like to continue showing fans our new image for upcoming activities. We once saw an online comment that read, ‘When does Dia take a break?’ But we are still hungry for more action,” Dia said.“We would like to become a group that can’t be missed in this K-pop scene,” it added. ""Love Generation” was released Tuesday at 6 p.m. via local music streaming sites. Dia will kick off its promotional activities for the new EP by performing at Mnet’s music program “M! Countdown” on Thursday. After debuting under MBK Entertainment in September 2015 with its first full-length album “Do It Amazing,” Dia released its second full-length album “YOLO” in April this year. The act dropped two Eps, “Happy Ending” and “Spell,” last year. By Hong Dam-young (lotus@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"

LG Display to Apply Multi-Channel Sound to Next-Generation Crystal Sound...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/030/0002665027?sid=004,"Fri, 08 Dec 2017 10:06:00 +0900","			LG Display is planning to apply multi-channel sound technology to its next-generation CSO (Crystal Sound OLED).CSO is seen as a 'dream technology' that produces sound from a display.  If sound comes from a screen, it will be able to maximize sense of immersion from a viewer as this screen is able to implement sound that is one with a screen.  Although flat speaker technology has been available for years, research on development of a display that produces sound has been remote.""Direction of development of future CSO will be towards a way where sound is produced from multi-channels."" said Senior Researcher Park Kwan-ho of LG Display through an interview with The Electronic Times.Senior Researcher Park has been the task leader of LG Display's CSO and he has led development of CSO at the front line of research on CSO.CSO is based on a principle that provides sound by making a screen vibrate.  Exciter, which is an actuator part of a speaker, is attached on the back of an OLED panel.  Exciter is a part that vibrates diaphragm so that sound can come out.  CSO is attached to an OLED panel instead of a diaphragm and produces sound.LG Display is planning to apply multi-channel sound to its next-generation CSO and is busy with performing related research.  Multi-channel sound indicates 4-channel stereo or 5.1-channel sound that provides sound from every direction.  Because multi-channel produces sound from various channels, it increases sense of immersion and sense of space that viewers feel.CSO currently produces 2-channel stereo sound, which indicates three-dimensional sound.  It implements location of an actual recording scene where sound is coming from as it is.  Through stereo sound, viewers are able to feel sense of immersion as if they are on scene.  In general, TVs are applied with 2-channel stereo sound that utilizes the left and the right channels.LG Display’s 65-inch UHD Crystal Sound OLED panel Enhanced R&D knowhow was applied for a process that overcomes interferences between channels of CSO and optimizes 2-channel stereo sound.  Due to this, LG Display applied for about 40 patents related to CSO in South Korea and other countries.If multiple exciters are attached on top of single diaphragm, interference between channels is inevitable and this leads to poor sound quality.  Interference between channels induces distortion and it damages sense of space and sound image.  This is why multi-channel sound technology is seen as an advanced technology.""Although 2-channel stereo sound also provides sense of space, multi-channel sound can emphasize sense of space of a recording scene even more."" said Senior Researcher Park.  ""Sense of immersion will be maximized if multi-channel sound technology is added to sense of immersion produced by sound that is one with a screen.""Industries have made numerous attempts in order to develop displays that can produce sound.  In case of LCD, it diminishes or distorts sound as there are many layers of gaps between panels.  However because OLED does not have any space between panels, it is able to vibrate sound directly and it can minimize any changes in quality of sound.CSO is designed to vibrate panels upward and downward so that viewers cannot see any vibration of sound from a TV screen.  Senior Researcher Park explained that human eyes can detect vibration of sound if panels are vibrated from side to side.  Also panels are vibrated so fast and so finely that human eyes cannot see any vibration.  As a result, viewers will not see any vibration even though panels are vibrating.Staff Reporter Lee, Youngho | youngtiger@etnews.com [Copyright ⓒ 전자신문 & 전자신문인터넷, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지]"

A Research Team Succeeds in Making Telecommunication with LED and Camera...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/030/0002524634?sid=105,"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 12:15:00 +0900","			A generation where telecommunication is possible with only light and camera CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) and without separate telecommunication network is here.  It is predicted that LBS (Location Based Service) and IoT services will be implemented through Smartphones and others in places where there are LED lights.A research team led by Professor Han Sang-kook of Yonsei University made an announcement on the 11th that it has implemented 'optical camera telecommunication' that can send and receive data at speed of 9kbps by using LED lights and camera image sensor.  This is currently the world's fastest speed and research organizations from England other countries have only reached 2 to 3kbps so far.Optical camera telecommunication has a similar method as LiFi that utilizes LED lights as telecommunication.  LiFi uses visible ray onto LED lights to send and receive data.  Although it feels that LED lights are continuous in human's eyes, it flickers once out of one million times.  Optical camera telecommunication can recognize flickers as digital signals of '0' and '1' and make telecommunications through wavelength rather than frequency.  Theoretically, it can send data at speed that is 100 times faster than WiFi.A device such as PD (Photodiode) that can send and receive data is needed for LiFi.  Not only LED lights are needed to establish telecommunication infrastructures but receivers and transmitters for optical telecommunication are also needed.  Professor Han believes that it is too expensive and is not suitable to install it into Smartphones.  This indicates that it lacks mobility.Optical camera telecommunication that is developed by a research team led by Professor Han utilizes camera image sensors as receivers and transmitters and allows telecommunication from small and light IT devices.  Recently, it succeeded in receiving and sending data through image sensors that are in Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Smartphones.Research team is applying 'algorithm that can draw image sensor data at high speed', which is registered as a patent, and working on a research that will increase speed of telecommunication.  ""Considering current status of development, it will be possible to implement services with tens of Mbps speed in 2018."" said Professor Han.  Although right now is at a level where only text data is able to be sent, images and small video files will be able to be sent and received through image sensors when there is speed of Mbps.When this technology is commercialized, LBS can be implemented in places where there are LED lights.  If this technology is applied to image sensors from black boxes of vehicles, 'connected car' that can send and receive data through LED backlights and communication with LED street lights can be made.  ""We are also currently working on AR service that is based on image sensor through many flickers of visible ray."" said Professor Han.  ""We are looking at many different applicable fields.""Meanwhile, results from research of Professor Han's research team is submitted to two SCI-level (Science Citation Index) journals.

Girl group 'centers' are now a thing of the past,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000009256?sid=106,"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 16:24:00 +0900","    Girl group Blackpink has no “center,” referring to a particular member who receives the most support from the agency and is consequentially most popular. More girl groups nowadays are seeking to succeed as a team rather than by designating a center. [YG ENTERTAINMENT]       “Who is the center of this group?”      This is a question K-pop fans often ask when they first start getting to know a certain band.    In the K-pop industry, “center” is a term that refers to a group member who receives the most support and publicity from their agency. A center often literally stands in the center during a performance, has the most song lines and screen time in music videos, and is prioritized when appearing on TV shows. Naturally, the center becomes the most recognizable and popular figure of the group.    The tendency to designate and promote a member as the center was most noticeable among girl groups, which usually did not have fan bases as large and loyal as boy bands did.    “Fans of boy bands, predominantly women, are usually larger in number and more loyal than fans of girl groups” said pop culture critic Jeong Deok-hyun. “As a result, members of a boy band are more likely to evenly receive attention from the fan base, while girl groups need to work harder to appeal to the general public.”     Yoona, standing in the center, was the center of girl group Girls' Generation - setting the tone for girl groups that came after their debut in 2007. [SM ENTERTAINMENT]       A center is considered to be the face of a group. Old-school K-pop girl groups such as Girls’ Generation, Miss A and AOA, which debuted between 2007 and 2012 respectively, had members Yoona, Suzy and Seolhyun as their unshakeable centers. The centers took the lead in captivating the public’s attention, and an attractive center was a must for a group’s success.    Nowadays, however, the distinction between a center and other non-center members is becoming increasingly blurry. More girl groups are distributing lines and screen time evenly among members instead of focusing on just one center.    “When I watch Blackpink’s music videos or concerts, I have no idea who the center is,” said a new fan of four-member girl group Blackpink. “The camera or spotlight doesn’t focus on any particular member.”    This changing trend is especially apparent among so-called fourth generation girl groups that debuted around 2018, such as (G)I-DLE and ITZY, that have no particular member as their centers.       Line distribution for Blackpink's song ""Lovesick Girls"" (2020). [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Line distribution for girl group ITZY's song ""Not Shy"" (2020). [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Line distribution for girl group GFriend's song ""Mago"" (2020). [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Line distribution for girl group IZ*ONE's song ""Panorama"" (2020). [SCREEN CAPTURE]     The phenomenon has been visualized on fan pages that analyze line distributions among members and turn them into pie charts. YouTube channel HEXA6ON’s pie charts show that many girl groups today divide a song’s lines almost exactly evenly, even if they have a large number of members like six-member groups GFriend and (G)I-DLE and 12-member group IZ*ONE.    Designating a center member used to be a reasonable strategy in the K-pop industry. Management agencies aimed for a trickle-down effect, hoping that the center’s popularity would cause the group as a whole to become well-known.    The current K-pop girl group system is considered to have been established around 2007, when iconic K-pop acts Girls’ Generation, Wonder Girls and Kara debuted. The success of nine-member group Girls’ Generation sparked a trend of girl groups with a large number of members, which quickly saturated the K-pop scene.    A rapid increase of girl groups and the number of members meant it was impossible for every single member to catch the public eye. Agencies had to pick and choose a certain member to focus on for the group’s survival, concentrating most of its resources on the selected center so that she would gain popularity and promote the group’s name.    “Entertainment giants like SM Entertainment could afford to send members out to appear on various outlets such as TV series and radio shows, but those opportunities were limited for small and medium-sized agencies,” said pop culture critic Kim Jeong-hyeon. “They had to give all their opportunities to one center.”       Seolhyun, considered to be the center of girl group AOA. [ILGAN SPORTS]     Such strategy indeed worked for girl groups AOA, EXID and Miss A. AOA member Seolhyun appeared in numerous commercials, movies and TV series. Seolhyun was well-known to the Korean public even if they had never heard of the group AOA. Eventually as time passed, AOA as a whole became more well-known as Seolhyun rose to fame.    EXID, a group that was initially met with lukewarm success, also rapidly gained popularity in 2014 when a fan's individual video clip of member Hani’s performance went viral online.    However, the trickle-down strategy is as risky as it may be effective. Other members may hold a grudge against the center for monopolizing the spotlight even though they all worked hard together. As a result, the group’s team spirit may become shaky.    “The trickiest situation is when the center is not the main vocalist, and the main vocalist is less popular than the center,” said an entertainment firm insider. “The main vocalist sings the majority of the song and does most of the work during the recording process and may get extremely frustrated if the center receives all the attention.” A number of girl groups have split up or had members leave the team due to conflict revolving around this issue, the insider added.    Ever since the mid-2010s, management agencies have been breaking away from the center strategy, no longer focusing on just one member. Girl group Twice debuted in 2015 under JYP Entertainment and initially pushed member Nayeon as the center, but soon started shining the spotlight on other members including Tzuyu and Sana.       Suzy, considered to be the center of former girl group Miss A, which disbanded in 2017. [KOREA JOONGANG DAILY]     JYP Entertainment reportedly learned its lesson the hard way from its former four-member girl group Miss A, which debuted in 2010. The agency had high expectations of the team as a whole, but when member Suzy gained a disproportionate amount of popularity and started starring in TV series, the group was soon only a name and eventually disbanded in 2017.    The experience led JYP Entertainment to limit Twice members’ individual activities, such as solo appearances in commercials and TV shows, to prevent certain members from taking all of the spotlight. Agencies now focus on the fountain effect as opposed to the trickle-down effect; instead of relying on one member’s popularity to promote the group, the entire group shares the spotlight in order to grow together. The bottom line is that a group can only last if they succeed as a group.          “Fourth generation” girl group ITZY debuted in 2019 under JYP Entertainment and also has no particular member as its center. Instead, the group emphasizes diversity and its success as a team. [JYP ENTERTAINMENT]      The shift also reflects another change in social trends. A girl group’s center was often the most conventionally attractive member of the group. However, as beauty standards are becoming, slowly but surely, more diversified, selecting the most conventionally attractive member as the center of attention and opportunities may not sit well with fans from a generation that values fairness and political correctness.    ”I think we can call this a ‘multi-center’ system or a ‘no-center’ one,” said Kim Jin-woo, chief researcher at Gaon Chart.    Kim added that the change may be a new strategy itself. “Since each member has a different image, this makes it easier for groups to change up their public image and concepts with more flexibility. When a group has a fixed center, its image is also fixed — but a center-less group has more room for various music genres, therefore enabling various marketing strategies.”    BY YOU SEONG-UN, HALEY YANG   [yang.hyunjoo@joongang.co.kr]    "
Samsung Electronics Announces Fourth Quarter and FY 2020 Results,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002098113?sid=105,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 09:58:00 +0900","- Quarterly operating profit at KRW 9.05 trillion on sales of KRW 61.55 trillion  - Expects weaker Q1 results overall, memory market expected to recover in H1   By Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, January 28, 2021- Samsung Electronics today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2020.                  The Company posted KRW 61.55 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 9.05 trillion in operating profit in the quarter ended December 31, 2020. For the entire year, it reported KRW 236.81 trillion in revenue and KRW 35.99 trillion in operating profit.   Although challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic continue, company-wide efforts to ensure a stable supply of products and services globally helped Samsung’s fourth-quarter results. Profit rose 26.4 percent year-on-year led by display and memory chip businesses, but fell 26.7 percent from the third quarter due to weaker memory prices and sluggish consumer products sales, as well as higher marketing costs and negative impact from the Korean won’s appreciation.   The local currency’s value rose sharply against the U.S. dollar, euro and key emerging market currencies, resulting in a negative impact equivalent to about KRW 1.4 trillion compared with the previous quarter, mostly in semiconductor and display businesses.   The Memory Business saw earnings decline quarter-on-quarter despite solid shipments, weighed down by a continued decline in chip prices, the won’s strength and initial costs from new production lines. The System LSI and the Foundry Business also took a hit from the stronger won, even though orders from major global customers increased. Profit from the Display Panel Business grew significantly both QoQ and YoY, thanks to a sharp rise in mobile display production and improved demand in the large panel market.   The Mobile Communications Business posted a QoQ decline in profit due to weaker sales and higher marketing spending. However, the results were in line with its earnings a year earlier, supported by continued efforts to optimize costs. The Networks Business saw improved earnings on the back of 5G service expansion in Korea and continuing 4G/5G rollouts globally.   The Consumer Electronics Division reported a quarterly fall in profit, as increased costs outweighed stronger year-end sales in developed markets.   Looking ahead, Samsung Electronics expects overall profit to weaken in the first quarter of 2021. The Memory Business will likely continue to be affected by the ongoing strength in the won and costs associated with new production lines, despite solid demand from mobile products and data centers.   The System LSI Business plans to expand shipments of system-on-chips (SoCs), image sensors and display driver ICs (DDIs), while the Foundry Business is set to increase 5-nm SoC and 8-nm high-performance computing (HPC) chip production. In displays, mobile display sales are expected to drop considerably after a strong performance in the fourth quarter.   The Mobile Communications Business is set to see robust sales of flagship smartphones such as the Galaxy S21 and new mass market models. The Consumer Electronics Division will likely post stable results despite weakness in seasonal demand, underpinned by new product launches and introduction of new premium lineups.   For 2021, the Company expects a recovery in overall global demand but uncertainties persist over the possibility of recurring COVID-19 waves.   The Memory Business, specifically the DRAM market, is expected to see a recovery during the first half thanks to strong demand from mobile and server applications, but geopolitical and economic uncertainties will likely continue. The Company will accelerate migration to 1z-nm DRAM and 6th-generation V-NAND to enhance cost competitiveness and technology leadership. The System LSI Business will actively respond to demand for 5G SoCs and high-resolution sensors with differentiated products. The Foundry Business also aims to expand mass production based on the 5-nm extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) process and diversify application areas.   The Display Panel Business will further enhance its leadership in mobile displays while focusing on timely development of new quantum-dot (QD) display products in large-sized panels.   The Mobile Communications Business plans to increase sales of flagship, foldable and new mass market 5G models while continuing efforts to improve costs. The Consumer Electronics Division aims to expand its premium lineup including Neo QLED, Micro LED TVs and Bespoke appliances.   Samsung’s capital expenditures in 2020 reached a total of KRW 38.5 trillion, including KRW 32.9 trillion spent on semiconductors and KRW 3.9 trillion on displays. Spending on memory semiconductors grew significantly for capacity expansion and introduction of advanced process technology, while investment in the Foundry Business also jumped on expansion of 5-nm EUV facility. The Company also increased investment for QD displays and new mobile screen technologies.   The Semiconductor businesses posted KRW 18.18 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.85 trillion in operating profit in the fourth quarter.   Overall demand in the Memory Business was strong, led by continued strong mobile demand, as well as solid demand from data centers and PCs. However, earnings declined due to the weak dollar and initial costs associated with ramping up new production lines.   For DRAM, mobile demand showed strength as major customers launched new smartphone models and as consumer confidence improved, while server demand was solid with cloud computing companies increasing investment in data centers. PC demand remained strong, led by Chromebooks and gaming notebooks, and graphic demand increased with the release of new GPUs and gaming consoles. The Company achieved solid shipments by actively addressing demand from mobile and as sales of consumer products, including TVs, increased.   For NAND, mobile demand remained solid helped by increasing demand from Chinese customers and growth in content-per-box. For servers, demand was relatively weak as inventory adjustments at major OEMs continued, while for client SSD, low- to mid-priced notebook sales was strong on the back of work-from-home demand along with demand for new gaming consoles.   Looking to the first quarter, earnings are expected to decline from the previous quarter due to continued weakness in the dollar and costs related to the ramp-up of new production lines.   For DRAM, the market for mobile is expected to expand with the release of new products and wider support of 5G for low- and mid-end smartphones. For servers, demand is improving as data centers increase purchasing and boost capex following inventory adjustments. PC demand is projected to be solid as demand for notebooks remain robust. The Company plans to optimize its product mix to actively address demand across all applications and strengthen market leadership and cost competitiveness.   As for NAND, mobile demand is expected to be solid despite weak seasonality as demand from Chinese customers increase and sales of 5G smartphones grow. For server SSD, data center demand is expected to gradually increase, while demand for client SSD is projected to remain robust. The Company will actively respond to demand from mobile and client SSD, while increasing production of 6th-generation V-NAND to strengthen technology leadership and cost competitiveness.   In 2021, business activities delayed by COVID-19 are expected to regain momentum. Mobile demand is expected to be robust on the back of Chinese customers and growth in content-per-box, as well as the expansion of 5G models. Server demand is likely to recover as data centers resume investment, while content-per-box for PCs will continue to increase. However, uncertainties remain such as geopolitical risks and a weaker dollar.    The Company will maintain flexibility in the product mix and accelerate the conversion to 1z-nm DRAM and 6th-generation V-NAND to strengthen cost and product competitiveness The Company will also continue cooperating with major global customers and proactively introduce next-generation products such as the world’s first multi-step EUV-based 1a-nm DRAM and 7th-generation V-NAND.   Earnings for the System LSI Business declined due to a weak dollar, even as demand for mobile DDIs and image sensors increased. With the release of the Exynos 1080, the Company’s first 5-nm SoC product, we solidified our foothold to continue leading the market and expand our customer base.   In the first quarter, demand is expected to increase mainly for mobile SoCs and we plan to expand supply of 5G mobile processors and ultra-high-pixel image sensors for new flagship and high-end smartphones in Korea and China. For 2021, amid uncertainties including the possibility of a prolonged pandemic, the market is expected to recover on increased demand from smartphone manufacturers and the Company aims to achieve double-digit revenue growth for the year.   The Foundry Business achieved a new record quarterly revenue, led by strong demand for 5G chips and image sensors as well as increased demand for high-performance computing chips. However, earnings declined due to the foreign exchange impact. The Company completed the design of 2nd generation 5-nm and 1st generation 4-nm mobile products, proving our leading-edge process competitiveness.   In the first quarter, demand is likely to remain strong for all process technologies and supply shortages is expected to continue for the time being. The Company will operate its lines flexibly by expanding the portion of advanced processes and will focus on developing 1st and 2nd generation 3-nm processes. For 2021, the overall foundry market will continue to grow and the Company plans to secure more global customers and diversify applications by expanding capacity centered on advanced processes.   The Display Panel Business posted KRW 9.96 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.75 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter. It recorded its highest-ever quarterly earnings, thanks to an ongoing recovery in demand for smartphones and TVs amid an economic rebound during the second half of 2020.   Mobile display earnings grew sharply QoQ as surging demand from major customers lifted factory utilization. Losses from large displays narrowed QoQ, helped by steady demand and rising average prices of TV and monitor panels, led by the expansion of contactless services.   Looking ahead to the first quarter, the Company expects mobile display earnings to decline QoQ due to a decrease in demand from major customers. However, utilization is projected to improve YoY as major customers increase adoption of OLED displays within their product lineups to align with the pace of 5G commercialization.   For large displays, the Company is preparing to launch QD Display products as scheduled while also continuing to fulfill LCD orders for some customers as planned.   In 2021, for the mobile display business, the Company expects OLED panel demand to rise for high-end models and OLED penetration to increase in mid-range segments, driven by full-blown expansion of the 5G smartphone market alongside a recovery of smartphone demand.   The Company will further solidify its leadership in the OLED market and diversify applications across note PCs, tablets and automotives, responding to uncertainties from the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing competition.   Samsung will also leverage its technological excellence and cost competitiveness and lead growth in innovative form factors such as foldable and slidable displays.   For large displays, the Company will develop QD display products as scheduled and build a stable customer portfolio to create a foundation for QD display to cement its place within premium product segments.   The IT & Mobile Communications Division posted KRW 22.34 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 2.42 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter.   While overall market demand increased QoQ as a result of strong year-end demand and gradual economic recovery, the Mobile Communications Business saw revenue and profits decrease QoQ on intensifying competition and higher marketing expenses. However, the Company maintained a double-digit profit margin by improving the cost structure through measures such as component standardization.   Looking ahead to the first quarter, market demand for smartphones and tablets is expected to decline QoQ amid weak seasonality. However, both revenue and profit for the Mobile Communications Business are expected to rise, driven by flagship model sales on the launch of the Galaxy S21 series and product mix improvement. Upcoming release of new mass-market products will also contribute to the growth in the first quarter.   In 2021, market demand is likely to recover to pre-COVID levels backed by gradual recovery in the economy and accelerating expansion of the 5G market. The Mobile Communications Business aims to strengthen its leadership in the premium segment through the Galaxy S21 series and expansion of the foldable category including the Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip.   The Company will also strive to improve its overall sales by expanding 5G device lineup for the mass market, as well as tablets and wearable products. It will also continue to expand the Galaxy ecosystem through strategic collaborations with global partners while enhancing the cost structure and operational efficiency further.   For the Networks Business, the Company improved performance QoQ by actively responding to 5G expansion in South Korea as well as growing 4G and 5G services overseas. The Company will continue with its network rollouts focusing on overseas markets including North America and Japan, and actively commercialize 5G network globally while seeking to expand new business opportunities.   The Consumer Electronics Division, comprised of the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses, recorded KRW 13.61 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.82 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2020.   In the fourth quarter, earnings for the Visual Display Business decreased QoQ due to intensifying competition in the peak season and rising costs. However, sales improved thanks to strong year-end demand in advanced markets.    The Company responded preemptively by expanding online sales, as well as O2O services. As a result, the Company successfully expanded sales in premium products like QLED, super large screen TVs, and gaming monitors.   In the first quarter, the Company expects the overall TV market to grow YoY despite weak seasonal demand. It will focus on driving sales by successfully launching Neo QLED TVs and prioritizing high-value products such as super large screen TVs and lifestyle TVs, while also developing tailored promotions for each region.   For 2021, Samsung will respond to any changes in the global TV market in a flexible manner and leverage its global supply chain management (SCM) capabilities.   For the Digital Appliances Business, the market demand increased slightly in the fourth quarter thanks to expansionary policies and “At-home trend” amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Flexible peak season promotions and premium product sales drove profit higher than last year, in both advanced and emerging markets including India and Latin America.   In 2021, the appliances market is expected to grow from pent-up demand from advanced markets. The Company will continue to focus on premium products, expanding the Bespoke platform to other product categories and enhancing global SCM capabilities. It will also further strengthen online and B2B sales, executing effective and tailored marketing strategies for each region.▶ 네이버에서 디지털데일리 채널 구독하기▶ IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드 [딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>		"

`My Generation` reveals troubles of young Koreans,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000047799?sid=108,"Mon, 29 Nov 2004 10:02:00 +0900","			  Today`s young Koreans do not know what poverty means. Living off their affluent parents, they upgrade their upscale mobile handsets in less than six months, and spend recklessly on fashion and leisure. Or so you think.""My Generation,"" a small-budget film directed by Noh Dong-seok, trains its camera on the largely ignored segment of Korean youth - those who struggle to survive amid mounting debt and utter hopelessness.Byeong-Seok (Kim Byeong-seok) is a hard-working twenty-something who dreams of becoming a film director in the future. But the reality is relentlessly harsh. He makes charcoal at a restaurant and works part time at a gas station, but he is unable to get out of sheer poverty.The prevalent image is a trap. He lives with a friend in a tiny, shabby rented room that suggest a prison cell. With an empty stare, he plays a video game at night, while his friend, who hawks health food all day twists and turns in bed.Byeong-seok, however, keeps dreaming. At least he has a video camera, a tool that he hopes will lead to a new career. But what he captures with the camera is cheap wedding shots in return for a paltry fee.He also points his camera aimlessly at pedestrians. There is no specific purpose, no explanation about what he is really up to.Jae-kyung (Yoo Jae-kyung) is Byong-seok`s girlfriend. Her life is as miserable as it can be. She doesn`t have any specific skills. Somehow, she gets a clerk job at a loan shop operated by a creepy middle-aged man, only to be fired on the very first day for being of no help.The fact that both Byeong-seok and Jae-kyung do not have a decent job reflects the nation`s thorny youth unemployment problem. While the overall unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, the figure for the 15-to-29 age group is more than 7 percent.Government policymakers talk about countermeasures, but there is no sign of improvement in youth unemployment. As the economy is mired in the protracted slump and new jobs are scarce, when a youth gets a job - whatever job - at a company, he or she is regarded as a ""jewel of the family."" Against this hopeless backdrop, Jae-kyung`s facial expressions speak louder than any other cinematic plots. She looks deeply gloomy and depressed throughout the film. It seems that she doesn`t know anything about vitality or happiness in her entire life.But Jae-kyung brightens up a bit when she meets Byeong-seok. They care for each other, though the circumstances are hostile, to say the least. Often, they sleep together in Byeong-seok`s compact car because they don`t have enough money to go elsewhere.In one scene, they sneak into the restaurant Byeong-seok works in the early hours and he serves a leftover dish to Jae-kyung. She hesitates to eat, while he urges her to eat it up, with a florescent light showering over the empty restaurant.The couple`s disheartening situation is in sharp contrast with the happy-go-lucky youth of Korea widely promoted by TV commercials and movies. It is almost painful to watch the couple navigate reality fraught with hostile factors and nasty people.Something more painful awaits the couple. Byeong-seok`s trouble-making older brother borrows money from a loan shop. The problem is that the brother secretly names Byeong-seok as the debt guarantor. Now, Byeong-seok has to pay back the money.The older brother visits Byeong-seok at night. The two walk the night street without saying a word. In the dark corner, the guilt-ridden older brother asks Byeong-seok to hit him. Byeong-seok can`t. The two simply collapse in despair.In fact, the devastating debt-guarantee problem among family members is common in Korea. Because of the tight familial relationships, it is difficult to refuse a request to serve as a debt guarantor for one`s family members. But when things go awry, the entire family and their relatives inevitably go bankrupt.Jae-kyung also finds herself in a financial debacle as she gets cheated in an Internet pyramid sales scam. To repay mounting debt, she attempts to get some loan by using her credit card illegally.Just like Byeong-seok and Jae-kyung, a growing number of Koreans including youth find it hard to stay above water. Naturally, the number of bankruptcies and financial problems similar to that of the couple is on the rise. According to the latest government figure, some 3.7 million people - one in six out of economically active population - are classified as defaulters, and each household has a debt of 30 million won on the average.Desperate to handle the deteriorating situation, Byeong-seok decides to sell his precious camera. Before handing over the camera to a new owner, Byeong-seok captures the image of Jae-kyung. After listening to what Byeong-seok will do with his camera and thinking about their miserable state, Jae-kyung finally shed tears.The movie, however, is not about hopelessness only. While most scenes are shot in black and white, the images captured in Byeong-seok`s camera are in full color, suggesting that the future might be brighter.Jae-kyung also urges Beyong-seok to turn off the camera in the last scene. Jae-kyung`s gesture indicates a glimmer of hope for Korean youth. Only when youngsters turn off the camera and take a close look at themselves and the reality, can the problems be surmountable.Main characters in ""My Generation"" are not professional actors. They are all part of the six-member (yes, only six) production staff. That`s why the production cost for this digital indie film is a meager 30 million won, which is extremely small compared with other mainstream Korean films whose budget easily goes beyond 3 billion won.Director Noh, 32, has made a feature film debut with ""My Generation,"" which will be distributed through the Artplus Cinema Network, a set of theaters which specialize in indie and art-house films.(insight@heraldm.com)  By Yang Sung-jin    "
Samsung Announces Mass Production of Industry’s First Mobile Image Sens...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002030885?sid=105,"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 08:30:00 +0900","- New 16Mp Sensor Enables Thinner Mobile DevicesBy Yun Sang-hocrow@ddaily.co.kr[Digital Daily]SEOUL, Korea, July 29, 2015-Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, today announced the industry’s first 1.0μm-pixel-based 16 megapixel (Mp) CMOS image sensor for use in advanced mobile devices.Samsung’s new image sensor, the S5K3P3, leverages the company’s proprietary ISOCELL technology to enable the high performance 1.0μm pixels. This market-leading small pixel minimizes the overall size and height of an image sensor module, making it an ideal solution for today’s increasingly thinner mobile devices. “As a trendsetter in the mobile image sensor business, we are pleased to be the first to deliver the most advanced 1.0μm-pixel imager, which meets both high-resolution and slim design requirements for smartphone cameras,” said Kyushik Hong, Vice President and Head of S.LSI Marketing at Samsung Electronics. “Starting with 16Mp sensor, Samsung plans to further expand 1 .0μm-pixel product category and lead the image sensor market for high performing slim mobile devices.”Built with 1.0μm pixels, Samsung’s new 16Mp image sensor reduces the module’s overall height by 20 percent, compared to current 1.12μm-pixel based 16Mp sensor modules. Enabling a module z-height that is less than 5mm, the S5K3P3 offers designers the ability to develop a mobile device with minimal camera protrusion without compromising on resolution.In addition, the S5K3P3 takes advantage of Samsung’s ISOCELL technology to deliver image quality that is on par with 1.12μm-pixel based image sensors. Using ISOCELL technology dramatically reduces color crosstalk of neighboring pixels by adding physical barriers between each pixel. This substantially increases light sensitivity and effectively controls the collection of photons, resulting in higher color fidelity even in poor lighting conditions.Combining ISOCELL technology with the industry’s smallest 1.0μm pixels, the new S5K3P3 image sensor will provide manufacturers with a differentiated design option. Samsung’s new S5K3P3 image sensor is available today for mobile device manufacturers to design into their next-generation products.IT언론의 새로운 대안[디지털데일리]IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]윤상호(crow@ddaily.co.kr)<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>"

\<PRNewswire\>Hikvision's Third-Generation Turbo HD brings 4K Video,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0008277600?sid=104,"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 11:04:00 +0900","			to Analog Systems    -- Now with higher video performance, increased compression efficiency, longer transmission distances and Power over Coax technology while retaining seamless compatibility with existing analog and network IP cameras from most manufacturers    [편집자 주] 본고는 자료 제공사에서 제공한 것으로, 연합뉴스는 내용에 대해 어떠한 편집도 하지 않았음을 밝혀 드립니다.    (HANGZHOU, China, March 24, 2016 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) Analog CCTV users can now enjoy 5MP HDTVI and 4K video resolution while safeguarding their investment with existing cabling infrastructure. Hikvision is launching its third-generation analog HD solution. Turbo HD 3.0 not only ensures higher video performance with up to 5MP HDTVI input and 4K video output but also supports latency-free 1080p HD video up to 800m and HD720p transmission up to 1200m over coaxial cable.    1080p HD, 5MP HDTVI and 4K video performance    Turbo HD 3.0 retains the ease-of-use of an analog system while offering up to 5MP video and makes high-definition surveillance systems possible without replacing existing cabling or switching to IP cameras. Turbo HD 3.0 uses HDTVI technology, eliminating compatibility issues whenever you have to mix old technology with new products, and making installation simple and cost-effective.    H.264+ compression technology    Hikvision's high-calibre H.264+ compression technology improves encoding efficiency by up to 50% compared to standard H.264, dramatically reducing bitrates while maintaining high transmission quality without losing forensic details. With data costs a high priority for most users, Hikvision's H.264+ reduces memory demands in existing DVRs/NVRs and markedly reduces data storage costs.    Up to 1200m HD transmission via coaxial cable    Hikvision Turbo HD 3.0 technology guarantees up to 1200 meters of high-quality HD720p transmission and up to 800 meters of HD1080p video via coaxial cable, distances unattainable by HD-SDI or conventional analog solutions. The increased transmission distances mean that larger projects can be tackled while existing systems can be extended quickly and easily.    Easier installation with Power-over-Coax (PoC)    Hikvision's Power-over-Coax (PoC) feature radically simplifies installation, as one coaxial cable carries both the video signal and the power supply. This translates to reduced installation time, which also translates to a reduction in both installation and material costs. In addition, the Turbo HD 3.0 analog solution supports UTC for remote set-up and configuration and enables control of the OSD menu and PTZ control via coaxial cable, enabling faster camera installation and easier management.    Extensive compatibility with the majority of products from other manufacturers    Hikvision offers a comprehensive range of 1080p and 720p cameras including bullet, turret, and dome types - including PTZ - for indoor and outdoor use. Of note is Hikvision's full range EXIR series with 2MP and 3MP resolution, which excels in superior image clarity in ultra-low light environment. Most feature advanced technologies such as digital noise reduction, ultra-low-light illumination, Smart infrared (IR), motorized varifocal lenses, IP66 rating, and vandal-proof housings. A 5MP fisheye model will be available in the coming Q2.    The Turbo HD 3.0 DVR products are available in 1/1.5/2U sizes, supporting camera input with up to 5MP resolution. The units could fit in different applications from small to large scale with ONVIF-compliant IP cameras supported for necessary system expansion.    Hikvision's advanced, industry-leading manufacturing technologies also ensure that the flexible Turbo HD 3.0 solution offers seamless compatibility with the majority of products from other manufacturers.    About Hikvision    Hikvision is the world's leading supplier of video surveillance solutions. Featuring the industry's strongest R&D workforce, Hikvision uses its state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities to design and develop innovative CCTV and video surveillance products for any security need.

2030 generation craves for change,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000044174?sid=108,"Mon, 31 May 2004 13:32:00 +0900","			  The younger generation in their 20s and 30s may not agree that ""older is wiser"" but unlike many of their elders, the changes they seek appear practical, rather than ideological.Park Ji-yoon, a politics major at Ewha Womans University, voted for the Democratic Labor Party in the April 15 general elections but said she had no interest in the ideology. She dreams of becoming a diplomat in the near future, and ideological debate seems a waste of valuable time.""Who cares about ideology? Conservative, or progressive, everyone has to live on money. If I had time, I`d rather use it to sleep off my weariness than debate,"" she said.Park may sound cynical, even selfish, to the older generations which worked hard for political change and democracy but she did have a reason for voting DLP.""All parities seemed to be out of their minds at the time. Among them, the DLP seemed to be sure of their policy line at least. That`s why it got my vote,"" she said.The balance of Korean political power, which traditionally lay with older voters who favored a conservative government, appears to have given way to a new block of youth power - ""the 2030 generation,"" youngsters in their 20`s and 30`s.Korean politics have been treading a road of change since President Roh Moo-hyun`s victory in the 2002 December presidential election. And, in the April 15 elections, the 2030 generation, with a solid 45 percent of voters, played the biggest role in helping the liberal pro-government Uri party to steal the majority away from the conservative Grand National Party in the new National Assembly.The Uri Party got 49 percent of the 20s vote and 51.7 percent of the 30s. In contrast, 48.4 percent of people in their 50s voted for the GNP.The DLP`s success in securing 10 seats and their first representation in the assembly, was also credited to the 2030s generation.In polls taken before the general elections, the 2030s showed they would go strongly against the GNP and the Millennium Democratic Party for what was viewed universally as a blatant pre-election tactic in ramming through the impeachment of Uri`s ""golden boy,"" President Roh. Nearly 80 percent of the 20`s and 30`s opposed the impeachment.Alarm bells went off in the older heads. The national political arena had avoided debate on ideological issues for half a century due to the ""red complex"" stemming from the Korean War.But with the 2030`s spearheading the rapid change, the older generation began to feel the need for a discussion and a proper definition.House wife Lim Myung-jin, 65, gave a worried click of her tongue on hearing the words, ""2030 generation."" ""They say let`s change. But change what? They are too inexperienced, unstable to know and act better. It is extremely dangerous to think of North Korea as a brother and America as an enemy,"" she said.The surges of red during the 2002 Soccer World Cup flabbergasted some older members of Korean society. The younger generation`s unabashed display of red literally had many of the older generation wincing because it , stirred up bad memories.For red is than just a color to the older generations of the South. It was synonymous with the communist North, the enemy. To the younger, it was simply a color that stood out.""I was surprised when media made a big deal of the color red,"" said Kim Geon-ho, a member of the ""Red Devils"", the rabid fan club for the South Korean national soccer team. ""We did not aim to brush off the `red complex` when we chose the color. If the older members of the society related the color with the red complex, then that`s just another incident proving the generation gap in Korea, I suppose.""  With the conservative establishment seemingly weakened after the April elections, critics say the conservative GNP, has little choice but to substantially alter its hard-line position on numerous issues, including South Korea-U.S. relations, North Korea, Free Trade Agreements and the planned dispatch of additional Korean troops to Iraq.But political experts like Professor Jung Han-yong, at Ewha Womans University, disagree with such an overview. The ideological divide in Korea has its own characteristics different to the western countries, Jung said.""In western countries, the ideological divide is comparatively clear. The debate on capital punishment and abortion separates conservatives from progressives. But our nation`s history has presented us with much more subdivided issues.""The 2030s go along the same road. They loathe the existing power that rejects change. But reasonable as they are, they know the need of U.S. assistance for the nation`s security and of the Free Trade Agreements,"" he said As Prof Jung says, the ""color debate"" seems to be far down on the 2030`s list of priorities. An economics major at Yonsei University, Han Won-young said the only thing that matters to him is the policies of the parties toward employment and working conditions.""The ideology debate between parties is interesting but pitiful at the same time. They somehow have the wrong idea that people change their attitudes due to the ideology lines parties establish. People will support the party with a good policy. The ideological suitableness comes only after that,"" he said.Prof Jung also said it was wrong to view the presidential and the general elections as a defeat for conservatives. He said that various overlapping issues added up to the progressives` grasp of power in politics, and any public dislike of the conservatives was not the reason.""The presidential impeachment and the progressive parties` new, clean, image made people vote for the president and the progressive parties. People detested stagnation and corruption, not conservativeness.""  Yon Sung-min, a 27-year-old graduate student, perhaps sums up that the younger generation is not against conservative ideology. ""I thought I was a progressive because I opposed the presidential impeachment. But somehow, I have hard feelings toward the North, and think the Korea-U.S. alliance is essential. Am I a conservative, or a progressive?  ""The whole ideology dispute is way too confusing for me. I wish people would let the past go and stop the arguments. I really think its time for the whole society to focus on the ways of the whole nation`s development instead,"" he said.Prof Jung said the biggest problem with the 2030 generation is that they crave for change without a reasonable alternative plan. It is this that makes the older generation worry about the 2030s.""Today`s 2030s have great antipathy towards the vested rights of the older generation. The uncertainty they feel brings out their passion to change the society, but they must remember to keep cool not to lose control,"" he said.By Shin Hae-in (hayney@heraldm.com)   "

Film asks young generation: `Who Are You?`,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000030375?sid=108,"Fri, 24 May 2002 20:20:00 +0900","			Poet Wallace Stevens once wrote, ""To be young is all there is in the world. The rest is nonsense."" Korea`s young generation today - whether it goes by the nickname of ""New Generation,"" ""N Generation"" or ""297 Generation"" - is living in a magical moment in time.While their parents sacrificed their youth fighting poverty and building a nation from ashes, young people today are armed with the latest cell phones and high-speed Internet connections. While their ""386 Generation"" predecessors forfeited their youth braving tear gas in the streets, university students today breathe only the aroma of a stunning array of coffees and pizzas with delicious freedom.Every young generation needs a story to call its own. Director Choi Ho`s new movie ""Who Are You?"" aspires to capture the mood of modern youths in Korea who lacked nothing as kids - except perhaps affordable bananas - and can hardly remember how people lived before the invention of the Internet.Hyung-tae (Cho Seung-woo) is a computer whiz who leads an Internet venture company crafting an online dating game called ""Who Are You?"" After a chance meeting, he falls for In-ju (Lee Na-young), an aquarium diver who works in the same building.In the age of the Internet, to be young and Korean is all there is in the world. The two poster children of the ""N Generation"" roam and chat in virtual locations ranging from simulations of Apgujeong-dong and Daehangno in Seoul to Lake Titicaca in South America, using the handles ""Melo"" and ""Byeori."" The only trouble is, In-ju does not realize that Hyung-tae and Melo are the same person.Inevitably, Hyung-tae wants to turn the online dating into some offline mating, only to find that In-ju is only interested in Melo, not Hyung-tae hiding behind the keyboard. Reflecting an age in which various usernames, passwords, phone numbers and e-mail addresses comprise the core of identity, the cyber sessions between Melo and Byeori sizzle while their real-life interactions fizzle.""Who Are You?"" portrays both the hopes and fears of Korea`s young generation. They do what they want to do and strive to live in a world of their own invention. Instead of being recruited into a large conglomerate, Hyung-tae bets his life on an Internet venture company. Meanwhile, In-ju swims in an aquarium with fishes and dreams of putting on a mermaid show that will become a hit.Their despair and uncertainty about the future are there too. Hyung-tae balances the satisfaction of doing what he wants with the grim reality that hints failure. In-ju thrashes and suffers in an aquarium, longing for air.The movie`s great virtue is that it depicts Korea`s young generation without distorting it through a predilection for the bizarre or the crazy as other ""youth"" movies have done. Their lives are drawn with sympathy, wit and most importantly, convincing knowledge.""Who Are You?"" grabs modern youth culture like a giant lollipop and melts it into every frame. Director Choi seems to place a stethoscope on the heart of Korea`s young generation to hear the sounds of an official soundtrack. The songs in the movie are the anthems of people in their 20s, ranging from the tunes they shouted as children at school excursions to the latest files being downloaded at Soribada.Local indie bands dig up and polish old gems like Deli Spice`s ""Ciao Ciao"" sung by Lee Jun-woo and Sobangcha`s `80s hit ""I Want to Love"" remade with punk flair by Lazy Bone. Crying Nut`s ""The Night Has Deepened"" and current favorite Roller Coaster`s ""Love Virus"" continuously weave memories in the background.Lee sparkles in the role of In-ju, shedding the artificial image of her television commercials featuring cutesy blinks and smiles. Instead, she runs, she sweats, she sometimes uses her fist to get a point across, and she even cries - all without losing her allure. Cho, who debuted as Mong-ryong in ""Chunhyang,"" smoothly leaps into the 21st century with relaxed smile intact.""Who Are You?"" captures the mood of Korea`s young generation faithfully. This is both the movie`s appeal and its limit. ""Are you playing a game?"" In-ju challenges angrily after she discovers that Hyung-tae is Melo. Well, in a strange way, it seems like everyone in the movie is. Their hopes and fears are genuine enough, but somehow, nothing truly digs deep to unravel the heart.The characters of the movie are living in an age saturated with irony. The sheer guts of past generations seem to have given way to mere style. Seriousness has been replaced by sarcasm, passion replaced by parody, and conviction replaced by humor.In the end, ""Who Are You?"" the movie is as addictively entertaining as ""Who Are You?"" the game. However, both ultimately feel transitory and in need of deeper meaning - perhaps like Korea`s young generation itself.(kimjin@koreaherald.co.kr)By Kim Jin Staff reporter"

Various events have also been hosted to exhibit its lead in e-business.Also, to prepare for a rush in demand for e-infrastructure, the organization of the marketing parts was enforced and the database solution sales division was expanded. Not only that, the e-hosting service business has also been strengthened and the cooperative businesses with other solution providers are being expanded while the support system is being reinforced.""We are searching for ways to cooperate with Korean system integration and consulting companies, and to strengthen the role of our Solution Partnership Center,"" said the spokesperson.To become a leadership in new technologies, such as Linux, wireless Internet, B2B marketplace or digital contents, IBM has reorganized its Solution team to strengthen the role of an independent sales division, which exclusively deals with Linux-related businesses. And through strategic cooperation, IBM is planning to become a leader in the industry and eventually increase the capacity to provide e-infrastructure solutions.Since IBM introduced the concept of e-business, it has developed into a future-oriented business model.""And now, it is taking root as a profit-generating business model,"" said the spokesperson. ""We have always claimed that the next generation e-business was about 3Is, innovation, integration and infrastructure of the existing systems.""IBM will do its best to make people aware that that it has the most suitable solution for e-business systems, complete with expandability, usability, security and openness."

Officials said that they are considering asking boy band Super Junior to be goodwill ambassadors as well.Promotion posters featuring photos of Girls’ Generation will be installed at Incheon International Airport and subway stations since both are frequented by many tourists.The appointment ceremony will be held at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the district office.By Lee Woo-young (wylee@heraldm.com) [Hot News] ▶ 95-year-old climbs out of coffin after being 'dead' for days ▶ Dog survives 53 days in wild, reunited with owner ▶ Mystery light excites British ▶ Nation's top baseball league suspends players implicated in match fixing ▶ 206 killed in Republic of Congo arms depot blasts "
Next generation of phones takes over as demand soars,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000114689?sid=104,"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 19:31:00 +0900","  SK Telecom’s LTE service to cover whole country from April Long-term evolution smartphones have been gaining new momentum as consumer demand is growing faster than expected.LTE is cited as the next-generation mobile technology following the current 3G, and promises to offer an Internet data transmitting speed of up to five to seven times existing networks.SK Telecom, the nation’s largest telecom carrier, announced Tuesday it will complete the nationwide coverage of the faster fourth-generation LTE services by April.The company said it has advanced the original schedule set for 2013, with consumer demand soaring recently for the new savvy cell phones.“The growth speed of LTE subscribers is unprecedented compared to our previous experiences in recent years,” Jang Dong-hyun, SKT’s chief marketing officer, said during a news conference. “Based on our market research, we are sure that a growing number of consumers are well-aware of the superiority of LTE phones in terms of speed and picture quality.” The company, which launched LTE phones in June, said more than 35 percent of its new subscribers are choosing LTE phones.The company’s LTE subscribers amounted to 260,000 as of Tuesday and the number is expected to reach 700,000 at the end of this year.SKT plans to offer the services in 28 cities in January next year and in 84 cities nationwide in April. Other than the major cities, it will expand services to busy areas such as campus towns and workplaces with more than 1,000 employees.While the domestic market leader has shifted recently to take a more aggressive LTE strategy, LG Uplus, the third-largest telecom carrier, has moved faster to gain the upper hand in the rapidly emerging market.The company aims to complete nationwide 4G networks in 82 cities nationwide by the first half of next year and to expand services into every corner of the country as early as in the first half of next year.“The untapped LTE market is crucial for us,” said Kim Yoon-ok, a spokesperson for LG Uplus.“In order to overcome our third-place player image among consumers, we are concentrating all our capacities in the business. There is no doubt that going forward for LTE is the unavoidable future trend.” The company has about 180,000 LTE subscribers and expects the number could reach 500,000 within the year.KT has yet to launch the LTE services as it is waiting for an approval from the Korea Communication Commission in order to withdraw its 2G services.The company plans to unveil three LTE smartphones, including Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy Note, as soon as the KCC approval comes out within November.Despite the soaring popularity of LTE cellphones here, however, the increased cost is still an issue for mobile carriers and handset makers.LTE phone plans will be not offering limitless data plans that would cause a bigger burden for consumers in terms of phone bills.The telecommunication regulator thus far has been passive in allowing the limited data plans as higher fees will be a blow to its policies for trimming phone bills.With the discussions still ongoing, SKT unveiled limited data plans targeting especially heavy data users.“Thus far, there has been no big problem in limitless data plans based on phone calls. But when it comes to LTE phones, their data use and quantity is extremely diverse. The number of heavy data users is fast increasing,” said Jang.The guidelines for SKT will be significant for phonemakers, most of which have already chosen SK as their network partner, and other network providers, LG Uplus, which will most likely follow once the standards have been set.By Lee Ji-yoon (jylee@heraldm.com)"
Young Diplomats Academy inspires brave new generation,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000197041?sid=104,"Mon, 05 Feb 2018 18:29:00 +0900","Thai Ambassador to Korea Sarun Charoensuwan (The Korea Herald)Thai Ambassador Sarun Charoensuwan has served his country faithfully, cultivating a positive image and remaining mindful of how his words and deeds are perceived under his ambassadorial watch. The top diplomat from Thailand has also acquired “a vast range of general knowledge and experiences in foreign affairs, as well as related protocols and etiquettes” throughout his career, he told enthusiastic students at The Korea Herald Young Diplomats Academy and Young Opinion Leaders’ Knowledge Forum last week. The annual event -- organized by the nation’s largest English daily -- attracted some 100 students from elementary, middle and high schools from across the country over the weekend. Each year an ambassador and diplomat from different embassies in Korea are invited to speak about their profession and engage with young aspirants. Previous ambassadors in recent years include those from Germany, India, South Africa and Singapore. “Being a diplomat is a dream job for many people. It allows you to travel and visit many countries. It is a profession that comes with honor and respect,” Charoensuwan stressed. “As diplomats represent their own country and people, it is important for them to maintain a good image. You always need to look good because the way you look really influences how people think about your country.”In order to excel as a diplomat, one needs to adjust to the country he or she is posted in and make efforts to understand the local culture and people, he added. “It is also important to understand and be open to people from different backgrounds. You need to embrace cultural differences and appreciate diversity.”Noting this year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Bangkok and Seoul, the envoy said the two governments have agreed to increase high-level mutual visits and cultural promotional events.“Thailand is looking to Korea as a model for development and seeks to learn from Korea’s know-how and best practices to develop our country,” according to the ambassador. Thailand, with a population similar to Korea’s, also faces problems of a low birthrate and an aging society, he explained, adding its $467 billion economy relies heavily on export, with South Korea being one of its key trade partners. Located at the heart of Southeast Asia, Thailand is being transformed via mega-scale transportation infrastructure projects, highlighted Charoensuwan. The envoy expressed confidence that the projects would enhance Thailand’s connectivity with neighboring countries and in the region. “Thailand is famous for its fruits and unique foods, as well as manufacturing. Thailand has a thriving tourism industry and is a regional center of medical tourism.”Hugh Utting, the British Embassy’s head of trade policy, highlighted his career in the British Foreign Service -- the Foreign and Commonwealth Office -- through which he has been posted to countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East before coming to Korea. Utting was born in Busan and lived in Ulsan until he was 4 months old. His mother was a librarian at Sogang University and the British Embassy in Seoul in the 1960s, while his father was a lecturer of mechanical engineering at a university in Ulsan. Pointing out that he majored in economics to “understand how the world works,” the second secretary said, “It’s a fascinating time to be working on trade issues,” as the bilateral trade volume was $16.2 billion in 2016 through the European Union-Korea free trade agreement.“This shows the strength of the ongoing partnership between our two great outward-looking nations and I am very proud to be able to work with fantastic Korean colleagues to improve the prosperity of the British and Korean people,” said Utting. “The three most important things to remember to those wanting to become diplomats are staying close to people, asking lots of questions and studying hard,” he said during the Q&A session which was followed by singing a Beatles song with the students.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
Generation shift key in general election,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000043023?sid=101,"Sun, 04 Apr 2004 13:32:00 +0900","Incumbent lawmakers account for only 14% of registered candidates   By Lee Joo-hee  The April 15 general elections are all about new faces, with the list of candidates showing a huge generation shift.Only about 14 percent of candidates listed under constituencies are incumbent lawmakers, meaning more than one third of the National Assembly, and possibly more, will be filled with fresh faces after the polls.Over half the candidates are 40 years old or younger, with four out of every 10 in their 40s, up from three in ten at the previous parliamentary elections. Nine candidates are still in their 20s and more women are standing this time.The competition rate was estimated at 4.8-1, with a total of 1,175 contenders fighting it out in 243 constituencies nationwide after the two-day-long registration period that ended Thursday.The competition is slightly higher than the rate of 4.6-1 four years ago, but lower than 5.5-1 in the previous general election eight years ago.As registration ended, Korea entered fully into general election mode, with public opinion polls now banned from publication as campaign activities are expected to intensify.The new 299-member 17th National Assembly is to be elected at a crucial time of national confusion following the March 12 impeachment of President Roh Moo-hyun.A total of 243 parliamentary seats will be represented by legislators from constituencies, while the remaining 56 seats will be allocated to parties under the proportional representation system according to the number of votes they won.A total of 14 political parties registered 190 candidates for the uncontested seats, putting the competition rate at 3.4 to 1. Only six of the uncontested seat contenders were incumbent lawmakers.""Such a generation shift is an obvious response to growing public resentment toward incumbent lawmakers over their corruption and their old image,"" said political science Prof. Kim Il-young of Sungkyunkwan University.But it is not all positive, as such generation changes have already taken place in past elections, but to little avail in improving political corruption, he said.""In the 2000 general polls, for instance, the main opposition Grand National Party and the Millennium Democratic Party carried out an extensive change of faces, but parliament was nonetheless tarnished with corrupted politics after four years."" An effort to change the political landscape needs to continue after the candidates win the seats as well, he said.By party, the pro-government Uri Party nominated 243 constituency candidates, while the GNP submitted 218 names, the MDP 182, and the tiny United Liberal Democrats, 123. The fledgling non-parliamentary Democratic Liberal Party also signed up 123 candidates. Independent candidates reached 224.The most significant change among the candidates was an increase in the number of those in their 40s. Among the constituency candidates, more than 40 percent are in their 40s, a sharp rise from the 30 percent four years ago. In the 16th general polls 50-year-olds had dominated the race. This time nearly 54 percent were 40 years old or younger.By party, the average age for DLP members was the youngest at 41, followed by the Uri Party at 49, the MDP at 51 and the GNP at 52.A number of women candidates also expanded notably. Most of the major political parties including the Uri Party and the MDP filled half of their candidate places for the proportional representative seats with women.A total of 66 women threw their hats into the ring in constituencies, reaching 5.6 percent of the total. This is nearly double the ratio of 3.2 percent in the 2000 polls.The wealthiest of all the candidates was Chung Mong-joon, son of late Hyundai Founder Chung Joo-young, who reported his assets at 257 billion won. At the opposite end was Park Joo-chun, an independent runner currently jailed for alleged corruption, who reported his assets at minus 1.9 billion won. The National Election Commission will vet all the candidates by April 8 to see whether they are eligible to run.Among the candidates, 31 have never paid taxes in the past five years.A large number of contenders, or 39 percent, were professional politicians, such as district party chapter leaders, party members or lawmakers.Of the rookies, 91 were lawyers and 71 were educators.A large majority, or over 85 percent, were college graduates, while 14 have never attended schools and nine were elementary school graduates.By region, South Chungcheong Province showed the highest competition rate at 5.7-1, while it was 5.2-1 in Seoul, 4.7-1 in Busan, 5.3-1 in Daegu and 5.0-1 in Gwangju. North Jeolla Province also showed high competition ratio of 4.3-1, while South Gyeongsang was 4.5-1 and Jeju, 3.7-1.(angiely@heraldm.com  "

This place was built as a cooperation of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and CJ E&M (entertainment and media contents focused subsidiary of CJ) to become the next generation hub of the Korean Wave.Photo : Korea Joongang DailyThe Culture Creative Convergence Center is a place  free-of-charge, high-tech facilities and trendy workplace for amateur content creators.It allows the creators to commercialize their ideas, and it gives them a chance to export them also to the global market. In other words, it gives an opportunity for the contents creators to make their own contents, and after this the Center connects them with the producers and investors.I will now introduce the Culture Creative Convergence Center which is located in the first and second floor of the CJ E&M Sangamdong Center.On the first floor there is the Media Library that has a collection of books and digital contents related to the cultural contents. It is possible to find and read information by using the tablet PCs and touch screens available. It is planned that in the future the creative contents made in the center will be added into the database and it will become a professional archive that contains all the convergence contents. It is possible to watch the contents made by the new creators from the TVs in the Media Library.Photo : Culture Creative Convergence Center home pageNext to the Media Library there is the Creative Lounge. It is a place where the contents creators can relax and meet professional mentors and share ideas with them.There is also the Talent Studio. It can be regarded as the most important place, where the creators’ ideas come to life to create next future convergence contents.On the second floor there is the Motion studio that is equipped with facilities and equipment that enable the contents creators to make diverse fusion contents. It is possible to make animation as the Studio is connected to the photograph and video recording equipment. Also, it is possible to change motion to digital form and make new contents. At the time of my visit, there was a work in progress that was about making ballet motion into animation characters, which would then made into an educational book for children.In the Screening Lab the images of foreign convergence contents are being showed, and convergence contents where the stage and image effect meet are put on display. It is planned that contents for experience will be presented in the future.There are Music, Sound and Craft Labs as well, but the most noticeable was the Sound Lab. The most important place for the artists is the practice room. It is possible for the artists to personally play music and do recording and audio dubbing in the Sound Lab, and there are also instruments available for use.Photo : Culture Creative Convergence Center home pageThe Story Lab is a place where video contents can be edited, and so it is very important to artists that want to film movies and drama, and then edit it themselves.I am looking forward to see the activity of the new artists and the new fusion and complex cultural contents that will be created in this place that is made so that the virtuous ecosystem for the convergence cultural contents industry can be built in the future.This is the end of the introduction to the first step of the ‘Culture Creative Convergence Valley’ which is the Culture Creative Convergence Center. There are still three steps left and they are as following: the second step is Culture Creation Venture Complex, the third step is Culture Creation Academy and the fourth step is K-Culture Valley. I think that the Korean creative economy is very exciting, and I hope that you will also keep up your interest up and follow the process of developing these new and exciting ventures!By Choi Yoo Kyung and Nora Maaniemi for the Korea Blog, original words in Korean available here.Copyright ⓒ 1999-2013 KOCIS.

The cartoonist of the controversial comic reportedly insists that the story is based on information he acquired.The comic even talks about a Korean actress, Jang Ja-yeon, who committed suicide last year. Jang claimed in her suicide note that she had been forced into sex with top figures in the entertainment and business world. It repeats words such as “suicide,” “lobby” and “corruption” and “sex-for-favor,” intended, netizens claim, to harm the image of the Korean entertainment industry and the Hallyu boom in Japan.The agencies representing KARA and Girls’ Generation are considering measures to deal with the comic.

[Greogry Rodriguez] Image of Americans in post-American era,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000102593?sid=104,"Thu, 13 Jan 2011 17:36:00 +0900","			 The ugly American ― the stereotypically brutish, ethnocentric, bumbling traveler abroad ― is dead. He’s gone the way of global U.S. hegemony, the strong dollar and mid-20th century American naivete.Thirty years ago, the streets of major European capitals were awash with wide-eyed, culturally entitled, middle-class American tourists who were members of the first generation to take advantage of foreign travel. Once the exclusive province of the elite, the Grand Tour (albeit scaled down) suddenly became available to the average suburbanite, supported by modern transportation technology, a strong U.S. currency and America’s unparalleled international status.But if global dominance produced a certain type of traveler, it makes sense that what Fareed Zakaria has dubbed the post-American era would produce another.I’ve spent the last three weeks in Britain, Germany and in Spain, and I’ve been struck by how unexceptional the American has become in Europe, as well as how the perception of us as a people is shifting.Far from projecting an image of narrow-minded superiority, Americans abroad today are more reflective of the country’s expanding diversity and cultural sophistication. They come from a broader array of backgrounds and traditions. Many still have strong ties to homelands around the globe.That diversity partly explains why one recent survey of hoteliers found that of all Western travelers, Americans were most likely to speak the local language.Linn Peterson, a Vermont native who has lived in Spain since 1977, says that 30 years ago, American tourists and expatriates were mostly interested in replicating the comforts of home abroad. “The people who come now,” he says, “are looking for something other than America.” It also stands to reason that we are less “ugly” abroad because more of us confront and negotiate all sorts of cultural differences in our lives stateside. From small-town Indiana to suburban Atlanta, Americans are bumping shoulders with people from many backgrounds and negotiating cultural difference every day.This cultural openness also comes at a time when the U.S. dollar is losing its dominance. That fact alone could easily be behind the change in attitude.“Americans were more rude when the dollar was strong,” said a longtime waiter at Madrid’s landmark Cerveceria Alemana bar. Today, he told me, they are mas suave ― more mellow.This more diverse, culturally fluent and easygoing American tourist also meets a world that knows a lot more about the United States than it did a generation ago ― and it can better match the new tourist to the new image.No more cowboys and Indians, for example. “Spaniards no longer ask how big our ranch is back home,” Peterson says. “Thirty years ago, most of their knowledge of us came from movies and TV shows.” Not only is the world getting smaller, but changes in the United States also have given foreigners more opportunities to identify with us. The historic election of President Obama two years ago is the example that many Europeans point to.Jeff Dayton-Johnson, a California-born economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, tells the story of giving a speech the day after Obama’s election to a largely African-born French audience.“People were crying,” he said, “and thanking me as if I had personally delivered the White House to Obama. The election really gave people a bigger sense of our population’s diversity. I don’t think they see us as a people so vastly different from everyone else anymore.” And we aren’t. In the 1980s, I lived in Madrid for a year, and I can attest to the fact that since then the cultural distance between Spain and the U.S. has clearly narrowed. The Spanish are more like us and we are more like them ― in the clothes we wear, the way we spend our leisure time and the size of the cars we drive.A week ago Sunday, for example, much to the chagrin of this country’s ardent smokers, a public smoking ban almost as strict as California’s went into effect. Likewise, the global rise of English and the mass-media-fueled international youth culture has made it a lot harder to tell who is or isn’t an American at restaurants, clubs and bars.The end of the exceptional American suggests that we’re not only more invisible, but we’re less of a target of outsize hope or disdain.Just a decade ago, in the days after 9/11, I was in Berlin, where I was easily picked out as an American, and strangers on the street offered me their condolences. Not long afterward, a fellow diner at a restaurant in Rome recognized me and my friends as Americans and started yelling anti-U.S. slogans at us. Admittedly, in 2011, the timing is less fraught, but no one picked me out as if I were wearing the Stars and Stripes, or made me a stand-in for U.S. politics.I suspect that America’s post-imperial angst and the rise of other global powers will have the world projecting less and less powerful feelings on the U.S. and its casual ambassadors abroad.

Cleaning up image of dictator Marcos,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000178703?sid=104,"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 16:13:00 +0900","			On Sept. 11, the Official Gazette of the Philippines decided to mark the 99th birth anniversary of the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, by releasing a graphic. What could possibly go wrong? As it turns out: Almost everything.The graphic produced by the Gazette carried a photo, a quote, and a caption. Under sustained social media criticism, the caption went through three editions -- each one deeply problematic both because of what was included and what was left out.The first version stirred controversy because it failed to describe Marcos for what he was, the architect of what he himself was proud to call “constitutional authoritarianism.” In other words, there was nothing in the graphic to suggest that Marcos was an authoritarian who changed the constitution to entrench himself in power.Instead, we got euphemisms like this: “He was the longest-serving president of the country for almost 21 years.” Withering feedback on social media channels was quick to point out that Marcos had engineered the declaration of martial law in 1972, just before his second and final presidential term under the old constitution was up. That was the reason he became, in the new Official Gazette’s view, the “longest-serving president.”The first version referenced the military rule that allowed him to “serve” until 1986. “In 1972, he declared martial law to suppress a communist insurgency and secessionism in Mindanao.” This is only partly true. The communist insurgency he used as an excuse was but an incipient movement. By 1986, the insurgency had spread throughout the country and grown to 24,000 regulars. The Mindanao secessionist movement was provoked by Marcos’ own interventionist plan. Marcos’ own diaries revealed that he was planning the imposition of martial law from the start of his second presidential term, all the way back in 1969.The first caption also offered a version of history that manages to praise the dictator. “In 1986, Marcos stepped down from the presidency to avoid bloodshed during the uprising that came to be known as ‘People Power.’” This is the exact opposite of what transpired: Marcos did not try to avoid bloodshed. In fact, he called on the military to attack the mutineers and their civilian supporters on Edsa. Also, he did not step down, but was -- in the chaos of a palace surrounded by protesters and enveloped by panic, on the long night of Feb. 25, 1986 -- ousted.The second version of the caption removed the mention of avoiding bloodshed, perhaps because the video and documentary record is clear that Marcos gave orders to attack. But this attempt at airbrushing history was seen, too, and denounced.Finally, a third version of the caption was tried; the second paragraph on the declaration of martial law supposedly to suppress the communist insurgency and the third paragraph on “stepping down” from the presidency were deleted. The first paragraph was tweaked to include the following last sentence: “He was the longest-serving president of the country for almost 21 years, declaring martial law in 1972, then went to exile to the United States (sic) in 1986 at the height of the People Power Revolution.” And a new one-sentence paragraph was added: “He was succeeded by Corazon Cojuangco Aquino.”The third version managed to correct one error present in the two previous versions. Marcos started his first term as president in 1965, not 1966. In those days, elections were held in November and presidential terms began on Rizal Day, Dec. 30. But other infelicities remained.The main problem persisted, too. The Official Gazette had failed to take the full measure of the Filipino politician characterized in both law and jurisprudence as an authoritarian leader, whose regime was marked by thousands of extrajudicial killings, tens of thousands of human rights abuses and the wholesale plunder of the economy. The neutral-seeming language the Gazette chose to use is a clumsy way to clean up Marcos’ image: He was not the longest-serving president but rather a dictator who kept his grip on power. It is not true that he “went to exile to the United States (sic).” He was sent into exile by a popular uprising.Now why would the Official Gazette under an administration that seeks to remember the atrocities of the Americans a hundred years ago attempt to cover up the atrocities of the Marcos regime, when these happened only a generation ago?(Asia News Network/Philippine Daily Inquirer)Editorial<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>"
Samsung Electronics Commercializes Next-generation Chip…,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0000591930?sid=108,"Wed, 30 May 2007 19:28:00 +0900","			   *Samsung Electronics Commercializes Next-generation Chip 'moviMCP'   Samsung Electronics stated on May 30 that it has started to supply domestic cell phone manufacturers with the ""moviMCP,"" a complex chip that builds a large-capacity memory card on the MCP (Multi Chip Package) used for mobile phones, which was developed by the company for the first time in the world.   The ""moviMCP"" has a 4GB (gigabyte) memory card in it, while the product has a total capacity of 35Gb (gigabit) by piling up a 2Gb NAND flash memory chip and a 1Gb mobile DRAM chip.   The forthcoming 4GB moviMCP consists of two parts: a 4GB memory card (""movi"") in which a mobile phone user can store various types of data including movies, pictures and music files; and the multi chip package (""MCP"") that supports high-speed image processing and mobile CPU for communications functions.   Particularly, the 4GB memory card which is composed of eMMC (embedded Multi Media Card) including two 50-NANO 16Gb NAND flash chips that were put into commercial production in April, can store an ample amount of data such as daily papers worth 25 years, 1,000 MP3 music files or a four-hour-long DVD movie.   Samsung Electronics revealed that the 4GB moviMCP development will enable domestic cell phone manufacturers to cope with the ever-changing 3G mobile phone market where a plethora of new products by so many companies compete by incessantly introducing slimmer models with multifarious functions added-high-definition digital camera, playing music files and movies.   Samsung Electronics have concentrated on developing fusion memory solutions: integrating two or more types of memory chips into one-for example, OneNAND, OneDRAM and Flex OneNAND-to preoccupy the next-generation cell phone memory market.  The chipmaker plans to reinforce the lineup of fusion memory solutions by successively exerting its technical leadership in the coming years.   Meanwhile, iSupply, the U.S.-based IT market research firm forecasted that the 3G mobile phone market which is to be the 4GB moviMCP's biggest market, will sell about 392 million handsets this year and continue to grow at an annual rate of 40 percent for the next four years.

Samsung Exhibits Wide Range of Next-generation LCD Displays at CES 2007,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0000017633,"Sun, 07 Jan 2007 19:22:00 +0900","Samsung Electronics will exhibit a comprehensive portfolio of next-generation LCD panels at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2007, which will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 8~11. Particularly noteworthy new Samsung panels include a double-sided 2.22” wide LCD that shows different images on both sides of the same screen for mobile applications, a 70” diagonal, full-HD LCD TV panel for the home, and an 82” diagonal, digital information display (DID) for public settings.  Samsung’s new 2.22” double-sided LCD being exhibited for the first time at CES 2007 is the first product to display two different images back to back in an ultra-thin mechanical package. It is 1mm slimmer than typical display modules (3.85mm) used in mobile phones, enabling truly differentiated multimedia handset designs.  Other commercially available double-sided LCDs simply consist of two panels placed one on top of the other that can only display the reverse image of identical screen content.Meanwhile, Samsung will introduce the largest (70” diagonal) full-high-definition LCD for consumer television applications. At CES 2007, Samsung will augment its initial success with 40” and 46” diagonal screen size standards by exhibiting a new 52” diagonal LCD screen standard that reproduces full HD video images at 120Hz with enhanced motion picture response time (MPRT).  The 52” panel will be produced later this year on the company’s most advanced 8th -generation LCD manufacturing line.For the lucrative DID  market, the company will demonstrate several products that enable system designers to mount giant LCD panels adjacent to each other with minimal distance separating the display’s active viewing area.  These include a 46” diagonal touch-screen DID, a 40” diagonal model with narrow bezels left and right, a 46” diagonal panel also for use with narrow bezel designs, as well as 57” and 82” diagonal DIDs.Finally, Samsung will display a wide portfolio of LCD panels for computer monitor applications, including a 30” wide aspect ratio model, which is the industry’s largest LCD panel of its type.  A variety of graphically-rich, ultra-slim high-resolution notebook PCs panels will be shown that are ideally suited to enhance the viewing experience when used in conjunction with the new Windows Vista operating system. The Samsung Electronics LCD booth is located in the North Hall (N238, 240 and 242) at the Las Vegas Conventional Center.<저작권자ⓒ디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>"
Talkin' About MySpace Generation,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/047/0000084569?sid=108,"Mon, 07 Aug 2006 11:42:00 +0900","			[OhMyNews Asad Yawar] I'm twenty-six years old. I was born in London, where I still live. I first surfed on the Internet back in 1994, at the now legendary cybercafe at Dillons bookshop on Gower Street near the nexus of the city -- though both the cybercafe and Dillons have long since vanished into oblivion. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, I was a rather minor player in the Dot Com Boom, though a rather larger figure in the subsequent bust. Every day when I enter my office, the first thing that I do after greeting the support staff is check my e-mail -- all three accounts. In short, I am theoretically a fairly developed product of the late technological era: young, urban and Internet literate. But already I am on the superhighway to digital obsolescence. Why? Until very recently, I did not even know what MySpace was, let alone have a MySpace profile. And for those born around 1990 -- a generation that can barely remember a world without mobile telephones and the Internet -- MySpace has become arguably the defining feature of what it means to be young. The figures are simply astonishing. From not even existing a little over three years ago, MySpace was purchased for $580 million in July last year by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. It is the most popular site in the United States -- more so than Google, more so than Yahoo! -- accounting for 4.5 percent of all Internet website visits. MySpace now has over 95 million members, with the number of new members joining every week estimated at anything from 500,000 upwards.   Yet these figures do not accurately capture the way that the site has become central to the lives of teenagers in America, and increasingly the United Kingdom as well. It has become the social forum of choice: interests are discussed, meetings arranged, gossip exchanged. Among those aged fifteen or sixteen, it is viewed as completely normal to spend several hours per week, if not per day, on MySpace.              But does this have any greater significance? Is MySpace merely a cultural fad? Or does it point to anything more profound? To try and find out -- and sate my own curiosity as to the nature of the Internet's most popular new trend -- I opened myself an account. Within a few minutes, it wasn't difficult to see the attractions of the website. The software is easy to use for the novice, yet more experienced coders can customise the appearance of their profiles seemingly endlessly. It is simplicity itself to link to new people. One can present whatever image of the self one wants to the world at large. It is fun and novel to be able to listen to new and established bands -- music is a big part of the MySpace community -- and other artefacts of ephemera, such as films and blogs. The flip side of these qualities -- usability, anonymity and a clear emphasis on the current -- is that MySpace is also one of the sleaziest and most sinister areas on the entire World Wide Web. The typical MySpace demographic of young, impressionable and often vulnerable and lonely teenagers is rife for exploitation by all manner of pedophiles and perverts. Wired News (April 18, 2006) did a search of randomly selected sex offenders in San Francisco and neighbouring Sonoma County in MySpace, and found no less than five men whose profile details correlated exactly with those on the state's online sex offender registry. In fact, there is such a proliferation of horror stories -- sexual assault, grooming, pornographic abuse -- associated with MySpace that many schools, public libraries and business are now taking measures to block out the web site altogether.            So in terms of long-term cultural potency, the site will probably rank somewhere alongside the text message: something that people will view as essential but in reality offers relatively little per se.  Ultimately, MySpace is a reflection of our society’s next generation -- maybe one of the purest. It is sex-obsessed, pop-fuelled, individualist and exhibitionist to the point where even an Internet-savvy twenty-six-year-old starts to be perturbed. As such, it doubtless points to a future that is more atomised and materialistic than even the likes of E.M. Forster -- whose seminal The Machine Stops (1909) foreshadowed much of the crushing narcissism of life online -- could ever have imagined.  - ⓒOhMyNews International (http://english.ohmynews.com) -		"
[HERALD INTERVIEW] Sonya wants to shake fixed image,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000064619?sid=108,"Wed, 16 May 2007 10:02:00 +0900","			 It was an exotic look and a unique background that helped Sonya, one of the most successful musicians in Korea, take on the role of Carmen in ""Fame"" and the unfortunate street girl Lucy in ""Jekyll & Hyde."" A difficult family history and growing up overcoming challenges as a biracial person in a homogenous country together made the actress adept to conveying sadness in her characters, which touched a soft spot with empathetic audiences.The 28-year-old musical actress said she hesitated to change her type-casted image of sexy and sad, but now she is ready to make the change.In the upcoming musical ""West Side Story"" to be staged later this month, Sonya takes the role of Maria, a serene and innocent character. It is something that she has never tried before.""I have performed too many sexy, dark roles so far. I wanted to change my fixed image and find a new role for myself through this musical,"" said Sonya in an interview with The Korea Herald.She seems quite determined and said that she is even considering giving up her role as a Gypsy in the blockbuster musical ""Notre Dame de Paris."" ""I do not want to go back doing similar roles I played in past years. I am thinking about dropping the role of Esmeralda in (the Korean language adaptation of the French musical) `Notre dame de Paris,`"" said she.She went on to explain her future plans.""I want to act more rather than just singing on the stage. I want to learn more about acting through taking on roles of homegrown musicals that have fewer songs than foreign musicals. I think I am getting to know what acting is about,"" she said.She was born in 1980 in Daegu to a Korean mother and an African-American father, who left her mother and her shortly after her birth. She was raised by her grandmother in a farmland area of Gimcheon after her mother died of cancer when she was eight. It was during high school that she realized she had musical talents after a teacher praised her singing in class.With the help of her music teacher, the girl who had to work in a factory to earn her living, started to make the public know about her story and her passion toward singing. A year later, Sonya made her debut as a pop singer in 1999 and also took the role of Carmen in the musical ""Fame"" in the same year.""(On the) stage is where my life goes on. It is a place where I should be for the rest of my life,"" she said.In her new musical ""West Side Story,"" Sonya plays a 16-year-old Puerto Rican girl who never knew about hardship.The idea of ""West Side Story"" was conceptualized by legendary modern dancer Jerome Robbins, who wanted to take the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" into the context of contemporary New York City gangs. With the joining of forces by composer Leonard Bernstein, librettist Arthur Laurents and lyricist Stephen Sondheim, ""West Side Story"" made its debut on Broadway in 1957. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the musical`s debut.The widely acclaimed musical retells the Romeo and Juliet tragedy of feuding families set in the upper west side of New York City in the 1950s. It deals with racial strife between a newly arrived Puerto Rican street gang and second-generation Americans from a white, European background.It has been staged in Korea several times since 1989. The Seoul Musical Company, which produces the 2007 version of the musical said it will recreate the musical into a modern production that appeals to a younger generation.The Korean language adaptation of the musical ""West Side Story"" hits the stage at Chungmu Art Hall in Seoul from May 26 to July 1. Ticket prices range from 50,000 won to 85,000 won. Call (02) 3141-1345 for more information.By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldm.com)"
First-generation dotcom leaders fade out in disgrace,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000036515?sid=108,"Sat, 23 Nov 2002 19:19:00 +0900","			Three years ago when the dotcom business boom brought windfall gains to Korea`s over-the-counter Kosdaq market, they were hailed as ""saviors"" of the country`s economy buffeted by the economic crisis.Now, in a twist of their fate, some of the former up-and-coming venture business leaders face the prospect of becoming jailbirds on charges of economic crimes committed at their zenith. Others have been kicked off from management due to poor performances of their companies.The arrests of the dotcom leaders added further strains on a downturn in the venture business sector as much-touted achievements turned out to be built upon illegal activities.On Thursday, in its latest move, the prosecution arrested Oh Sang-su, former CEO of Serome Technology, on charges of inflating its sales to keep the stock value high at the height of the dotcom boom in 1999.Oh was catapulted to the pantheon of Korea`s information technology trail blazers, when Serome`s market capitalization equaled that of Hyundai Motor at the time.Serome`s fortunes rose after it developed a free Internet telephone service known as Dialpad, which attracted millions of subscribers at home and abroad. But its fall began when the Internet bubble burst and its U.S. subsidiary Dialpad.com declared bankruptcy.In September, Lee Jin-seong, former CEO of Intz.com, an Internet media and e-commerce company, was sentenced to three years in prison, albeit suspended for five years. Lee, one of the first-generation dotcom business leaders, resigned from his position due to the company`s poor performance in August 2001.But he was found guilty of siphoning off company funds during his tenure as president.Praised as the darling of investors and analysts alike, Kim Jin-ho, former president of Goldbank Communications Inc., was indicted in August on charges of embezzling 1.43 billion won ($1.11 million) between March 1999 and March 2001.Before he was arrested, Kim tried to make a comeback to the venture business industry as a co-chairman of OZ Intermedia, an Internet-based game company. But the charges against him dashed any chance of a successful comeback.In a bid to improve its public image, Goldbank changed its name into Koreatender in March. But Edwin Yu, president of Koreatender, was also indicted for borrowing 4.7 billion won from the company in order to purchase shares held by Kim in March 2000.Some others, who do not face the hardships of legal charges, hang by a thread, as the economic slowdown has forced dotcom companies to downsize or consolidate their businesses.Lee Geum-ryong, former president of Auction, a major online auctioneer affiliated with U.S.-based eBay, had to resign in July amid a dispute over his management style with eBay, a large shareholder of Auction.Lycos Korea was taken over by SK Telecom three years after it struggled to head off challenges from such late dotcomers as Naver and Dreamwiz. Ga Jong-hyeon, former president of Lycos Korea, failed to meet the changing needs of consumers, letting SK Telecom use his Internet portal to strengthen the company`s fixed-line Internet service.""It is bitter to see the former venture business leaders step down under a cloud. The unmanageable flow of money and interest in 1999 and 2002, when the foundations of venture business were not solid, came back to haunt us,"" said the CEO of an information technology firm, from the first-generation group of venture business leaders.

Environmental endeavors help company create unique image,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000090898?sid=104,"Wed, 14 Apr 2010 17:36:00 +0900","			 What makes Yuhan-Kimberly stand out from the crowd in the market? That is its environmental campaign known as the Keep Korea Green, which has greatly helped enhance its corporate image, its vice president said. Lee Eun-wook, vice president of Yuhan-Kimberly Yuhan-Kimberly“Many experts cite good product quality and corporate image as the reasons for our market leadership. I think Yuhan-Kimberly tries hard to recognize and satisfy consumer needs,” Lee Yoon-wook said. A company should have something other than that to maintain the No. 1 position for a long time and to earn consumer trust. Many experts agree that the Keep Korea Green campaign plays a role in differentiating our company from others. Yuhan-Kimberly has long held top positions in major products including diapers, sanitary napkins and cosmetic tissues. The company also successfully launched Green Finger skincare products for infants and kids, a new category product, in 2007. “The skincare market competition was fierce, but Yuhan-Kimberly rose to the No.1 spot in just two years, with its eco-friendly concept. Although we have tried to make good products for a long time, we needed something special to appeal to Korean consumers and compete with global companies with our new products,” he said. Its Keep Korea Green campaign is so successful, so the slogan is used in all of its products, he said. Yuhan-Kimberly plans to plant 50 million trees by 2013 when the Keep Korea Green campaign marks its 30th anniversary.It also seeks to earn carbon credits in return for tree planting. Companies are able to receive not only a good corporate image, but economic benefits by carrying out social contribution activities.“Our goal is to reduce carbon emissions by growing forest, and to arouse our future generation to the importance of environment through education. “For companies, not only current customers but future ones are important,” he said.He also stressed that companies should widely publicize their social contribution activities to consumers.“It is important for as many as consumers to participate in corporate social contribution activities and understand and sympathize with a company’s endeavor. Through this process, a company can do better activities, and can achieve results in business,” he said. By Jin Hyun-joo  (hjjin@heraldm.com)"
Politicians use TV appearance to improve image,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000123032?sid=104,"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 20:36:00 +0900"," Conservative presidential hopeful Park Geun-hye has been regarded as a rigid practitioner of old politics remote from people’s present-day lives.Her liberal rival Moon Jae-in has been seen as a staid manager rather than a visionary leader. To an increasing number of voters, Ahn Cheol-soo, the dark horse, is viewed as an indecisive nerd lacking the guts for the world of politics.To shed these preconceived images, the three frontrunners for the December election appeared on late-night TV talk show “Healing Camp.”  The charge worked well. Polls show their images improved and support rates rose just after their appearances, attesting to the growing power of TV entertainment in election campaigning.But experts raise concerns that politicians’ resorting to show business could distract voter attention from serious policy issues.“Politicians, by appearing on entertainment programs, may tear down the stereotypes and befriend the public, especially the young generation,” said Yoon Pyung-joong, politics professor at Hanshin University.“But here lies a great danger as the voters may be blinded by the candidates’ friendly image and neglect the fundamentals such as their policies and political abilities.” On Monday, the main opposition Democratic United Party kicked off its presidential primary, but non-party rookie Ahn’s appearance on the popular talk show on SBS captivated public attention.Ahn, software mogul and Seoul National University professor, capitalized on the loose atmosphere of the chat with two popular comedians and an actress to lay out his political views and talk about his private life.His appearance came only days after the publication of his new book which increased expectations that he would join the presidential election.Ahn said he has yet to make up his mind. “I shall remain open to both options and heed the people’s judgment.” According to AGB Neilson Media Research, 18.7 percent of households across the country and 21.8 percent in Seoul watched the program.The figure was the highest ever for the program and exceeded those for Park Geun-hye and Moon Jae-in, presidential frontrunners of the ruling Saenuri Party and the DUP respectively, who appeared on the show in January.Park, the former Saenuri chairwoman broke away from her rigid and exclusive image somewhat, upping the support rates for herself and the party before the April general elections.Moon, who served as chief of staff of the late former President Roh Moo-hyun, also saw his approval ratings rise, after he tried to show his humble and candid aspects and spoke of his fond memories of Roh.Ahn’s appearance irked his potential rivals such as Kim Moon-soo of the Saenuri and Sohn Hak-kyu of the DUP.The two reportedly asked to be featured in the program but their requests were rejected.“Considering both political equity and public responses, we invited the top three presidential hopefuls, one from each leading party and one from a non-party domain,” said Choi Young-in, the show’s chief producer.Pundits are concerned that the excessive reliance on publicity may result in a regression of Korean politics in the long-term.“It is understandable that the people may want to feel closer to public figures but politics should be taken seriously as it deals with the nation’s security as well as its future,” Yoon said.Professor Kim Hyung-joon of Myungji University said the soaring influence of entertainment shows largely reflects the public’s distrust of conventional politics.“People should nevertheless remember that political support based on vague images may be just as harmful.” Ahn Byung-jin, professor at Kyung Hee Cyber University, however, said it is one aspect of politics adapting to the era marked by the increasing importance of mass communication.“Public communication has become an inevitable factor in modern society,” he said.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldm.com) [Hot News] ▶ Ahn: ‘Not afraid of getting bashed’  ▶ N.

Innotive Corp. aims to reshape image viewing technology,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000017463?sid=108,"Wed, 30 May 2001 18:58:00 +0900","			By Yang Sung-jin Staff reporterDownloading a large image file on the Internet is not only time-consuming but can also be frustrating.Even Acrobat Reader, a popular program allowing users to view and share image files on the Web, has yet to resolve the patience-testing download time, except for a few ultra-high-speed network users.But it's the visual interface that makes information so much more accessible across the Internet, Gartner Group stressed in a report.Innotive Corp., a venture startup in Korea, specializes in simplifying the process of downloading images. As PCs have limited memory power, reading and viewing large graphic files takes a lot of time. But Innotive's solution alters the way image files are viewed on PCs. It simply deletes the memory part and allows PCs to instantly view smaller segments of the whole picture.""There's no need for supercomputing power. No need for large PC memory. Whatever the configurations, users can view large graphic files easily and immediately,"" said Eum Yong-ky, CEO of Innotive Corp. in an interview.As the solution bypasses memory processing, the company's specialized viewer, called iBrowser, brings up a quick, seamless stream of images, Eum said.The solution does not require any hardware reconfiguration. Instead, users should install the company's iBrowser software and convert ordinary image files into IPQ, Innotive's proprietary image format.The potential applications are enormous, Eum said. Newspaper companies, for instance, can save their papers in image format digitally so that readers can download and read the papers on the Web as if they are scanning offline newspapers.Even though the image file size in question is astoundingly huge, readers can surf the pages smoothly without any interruptions as the solution slashes the loading time drastically.Thanks to its technological prowess, the venture firm obtained a government contract aimed at upgrading the Internet, a project called ""Next-generation Internet"" (NGI).Under the project, Innotive is working on the digital multimedia newspaper viewing program, which Eum said could revolutionize the way people read newspapers every morning.""Speed-wise, no program can match iBrowser in viewing large image files. Furthermore, it would allow each image file to have a number of interactive functions,"" Eum said.Offline newspapers tend to have a number of graphics for photos and advertisements but their Web editions lack these images due to the space limitations of their homepages.Said Kim Sung-min, COO of Innotive: ""We plan to add a variety of multimedia functions to our image formats, let's say Web site links, voice recordings, movie files and other functions.""Compared with conventional Web sites, such multimedia image files are highly intuitive and effective in delivering various digital contents just as the creators envisage them, Kim Sung-min said.The Web version of iBrowser, however, is not yet available, warned Hao Le, Innotive's Executive Vice President, the chief engineer behind the solution.The Canadian engineer of Vietnamese descent said he became interested in image processing while he was working for a satellite imaging company in Canada.Downloading thousands of satellite images every day, Le sought ways to view such graphic files with ease, without depending on super computers, embarking on research that led to the creation of this unique technology.iBrowser, based on Le's concept and technical architecture, can view 84MB satellite image files in 0.5 second while Photoshop handles the same image in 87 seconds.Le set up his own company called Flashback Imaging in Canada to commercialize the technology but things didn't go according to plan. He contacted U.S.-based venture capitalists and found it hard to work with them as most were only interested in making money.In 1999, Le visited Korea to participate in a seminar and came across Eum Yong-ky. They discussed the technology's commercial potential and soon established Innotive.In May, 2000, Innotive took over Le's Canada-based Flashback Imaging in a bid to crack a share in overseas image viewing markets.Innotive, established in March, 2000, has a paid-in capital of 750 million won and expects to post 2 billion won in revenue this year.(insight@koreaherald.co.kr)"

Conglomerates’ young owners tarnish entire group image,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0003372635?sid=104,"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 17:55:00 +0900"," The risk from grandchildren and grand grandchildren of ‘chaebol’ families is in spotlight as their single misconduct could have a significant spillover into corporate culture, business performance as well as the business group’s entire image.At a time when the ‘nut rage’ incident, which involves former vice president of Korean Air Line and a daughter of its chairman, Cho Hyun-ah, is having far-reaching consequences across the business circle, the nation’s major family-run conglomerates are controlling behavior of their third and fourth generation of group owners. Cho ordered a flight to return to the terminal and forced the chief flight attendant to disembark from the flight in a tiff over how she was served the nuts. The wider access to social networking service and whistle blowing are also reinforcing such risk as these factors make it easier for owners’ every single act to be publicized. Seoul Prosecution investigators Thursday raided Korean Air Line’s headquarters and its offices at Incheon International Airport to collect evidence regarding the case. “Cho has been asked to appear at the aviation ministry’s aviation safety oversight office by 10:00 a.m. on Friday, but she expressed reservations about it,” said the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport on the day. Accordingly, the ‘nut rage’ uproar would not likely subside with the resignation of Cho as expected by the airline. In addition, as the incident has triggered public rage, many Korean residents in the US are calling for a boycott of the airline, which would directly deal a blow to its sales.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]		"

Park strives to show friendlier image,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000116509?sid=104,"Wed, 04 Jan 2012 01:05:00 +0900"," GNP leader and presidential hopeful reveals private side on first TV talk show appearance Rep. Park Geun-hye, the Grand National Party’s chief and strongest presidential candidate, sang and made jokes with comedians on a TV show late Monday, attempting to change her long-time reputation for seriousness.Her first TV talk show appearance came as she pushes to remake the sinking ruling party ahead of the April 11 general elections. Polls released earlier in the day showed that her liberal rivals were gaining ground, riding on a strong anti-incumbent mood among voters, particularly those in their 20s to 40s.Park, too, trailed her potential presidential rival, Ahn Cheol-soo, in news media polls.Apparently mindful of the challenges ahead, Rep. Park attempted to highlight her sincerity in efforts to change old politics and better communicate with the people.“This is an era when one’s sincerity and communication skills are important. So I thought this could be a good opportunity to talk in a comfortable setting,” she said on the SBS talk show Healing Camp, explaining why she decided to participate in it.Park, though she leads a large faction within the GNP, has often been criticized for weak leadership, stubbornness and a lack of openness toward her colleague lawmakers. She has also come under fire for speaking as little as possible in public about controversial issues.On the show, however, she engaged in lively conversations with three hosts of the show, including Kim Jae-dong, a comedian known for his liberal political views and criticism of conservative President Lee Myung-bak and the GNP.She described Ahn as a professor popular among young people and said he was good at connecting with the younger generation.The GNP leader has recently made a series of efforts to win the hearts of young voters. She appointed Lee Jun-seok, a 26-year-old CEO of a venture firm, as a member of her leadership council, and Pyo Chul-min, another 26-year-old venture firm CEO, as an advisor.On the show, Park also shared some of her personal life and the pains she went through after her parents -― former President Park Chung-hee and first lady Yook Young-soo ― were shot to death.As the eldest daughter of the military strongman who ruled the country for 18 years, she grew up in Cheong Wa Dae. She played the role of first lady for about five years after her mother was killed by a bullet meant for her father.“Busy bees don’t have time to grieve. I remember writing this in my diary at that time,” she said. “I had dreams similar to what others of my age (22) typically had at that time. But I had to give them all up completely (to act as the first lady).”  Her service as first lady ended abruptly when her father was assassinated by his intelligence chief in 1979.She said she went through severe pain and stress that actually made her limbs bruised as if beaten.“I dreamt if only I were born to just an ordinary family...” she said.After the death of her father, she lived for 17 years as a near-recluse.“I lived as an ordinary citizen, out of the media spotlight,” she said.Then when the Asian financial crisis hit the nation in 1997, she said, she felt that she must do something for the nation which her father developed, and she decided to enter politics.“I live for only one goal ― the dream that I had when I decided to enter politics or the faith that I will devote my everything to the people.”  Her family background is both her strength and weakness.Park enjoys popularity thanks to her serene image that comes from pubic nostalgia for the Park Chung-hee era in which the country made a miraculous rise from the ruins of the Korean War. To her opponents, however, that is the key reason why she should not be made president.Near the end of the one-hour TV show, she was asked what she thought of her father’s 18-year rule of the country.“There are conflicting views now (about my father). It is really something the history and the people will judge,” Park said.She has never apologized for the faults of her father and to those who were brutally tortured, imprisoned or even killed under his dictatorship.By Lee Sun-young (milaya@heraldm.com)"

New looks change image of auto firms,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000093747?sid=104,"Sun, 27 Jun 2010 17:11:00 +0900"," Hyundai and Kia seek boost from improved design and engineering  Hyundai Kia Automotive Group’s two carmakers are carving out new images for themselves with new design principles and advanced technologies.New design philosophy of Hyundai Motor Co., the larger of the group’s two carmakers, began to show in its vehicles with the latest version of the mid-sized sedan Sonata and the compact sport utility vehicle Tucson ix that were launched during the third quarter of last year.“The underlying theme of Hyundai’s design concept is ‘fluidic sculpture,’ which combines smoothness with strength in organic designs,” a Hyundai official said.The change in the company’s approach to design first became evident in the Tucson ix that was launched in August last year.“The Tucson ix reflects the dynamic design of the concept car ix-onic, and by combining the sporty image and modern aesthetics, the design features of the Tucson ix were developed to appeal to young urbanites,” a Hyundai official said.Hyundai Tucson ix In addition to receiving a complete makeover in terms of design, significant improvements were made in terms of the engineering.Fitted with the 2-liter R diesel engine that puts out 184 brake horsepower, the two-wheel drive version of the Tucson ix manages 15.4 kilometers on a liter of fuel. The figure is not only 17.5 percent higher than that of the Tucson ix’s predecessor, but one of the highest among sport utility vehicles marketed in Korea.The car also meets the Euro 5 emission standards and has been recognized as a low-emission vehicle, making it exempt from the environmental tax placed on diesel vehicles for five years.The gasoline version comes with the 2-liter Theta II engine that puts out 166 brake horsepower and manages 11.7 kilometers per liter.The new Sonata, which made its debut in September, also underwent dramatic changes from its predecessor.“Under the theme of fluidic sculpture, the new Sonata was developed with orchids, which are supple yet strong, as the main design motive.” In addition to updating the design features of the new Sonata, the sixth generation of vehicles to bear the name, Hyundai decked out the car with its latest technologies.The smaller 2-liter engine used in the Sonata is capable of putting out 165 brake horsepower, and manages 12.8 kilometers per liter with automatic transmission. The new Sonata’s fuel economy is 11.3 percent higher than that of the previous Sonata, and makes the vehicle the first in its segment to receive the second highest fuel economy rating.The automatic transmission used in the vehicle has also been upgraded from a four-speed system to a six-speed system.In addition to the improved 2-liter engine, the new Sonata is also available with a 2.4-liter gasoline direct injection engine that puts out 201 brake horsepower and manages 13 kilometers on a liter of fuel.Safety features of the Sonata have also been upgraded in its latest guise. The new Sonata is the first in its segment to come with a vehicle dynamic control system that includes hill-start assist control and a brake assist system as standard across the lineup.The company’s drive to renew its designs is to continue in the new Avante. The new Avante that will be released in August Unveiled at the Busan International Motor Show in April, the car will go on sale in the local market in August.“The philosophy of ‘fluidic sculpture’ forms the basis of the new Avante’s design, and the concept of ‘wind craft,’ which incorporates the concept of the dynamic movement of the wind,” a Hyundai official said. “Using the theme of wind craft, an element of sportiness that has until now been unseen in the compact segment has been added to the new Avante’s design.” As with Hyundai’s other recently launched vehicles, the new Avante will also be given a technological boost.The car will be the first domestic compact car to come with a 1.6-liter gasoline direct injection engine that puts out up to 140 brake horsepower, and six-speed automatic transmission.While the details about the vehicle have not yet been revealed, the company says that the finely tuned engine and various fuel-saving devices and systems will give the new Avante more than a 10 percent advantage over its rivals from other local carmakers.The vehicle will also be the first domestic compact car in which side and curtain airbags and rear parking sensors are standard features.For Kia Motors Corp., the drive to establish a family look began ahead of Hyundai under the leadership of Chung Eui-sun, who now serves as Hyundai vice chairman, and chief design officer Peter Schreyer.Under Chung’s leadership and Schreyer’s directions as the chief designer, Kia adopted “simplicity of the straight line” as the theme.The large sport utility vehicle Mohave launched in 2008 was the first vehicle to embody the then new design philosophy. Since then the theme was applied to new vehicles as well as updated versions of existing models giving Kia’s lineup a distinctive look that sets them apart from other Korean automobiles.Starting with the Mohave, the company has put out a series of vehicles that reflect its new design philosophy and the process of renewing the designs of its lineup is nearing completion.Vehicles bearing the marks of change include the Forte, which replaced the Cerato, the Soul compact crossover utility vehicle and most recently the sport utility vehicle Sportage R, and the mid-sized sedan K5 and the large sedan K7.In addition, the company reinforced the “family look” of its vehicles with a grill designed to visualize the nose and mouth of a tiger.Starting with the Lotze Innovation, the tiger-snout grill has been continued into its latest vehicles.Among the company’s recent additions, the Sportage R is Kia’s latest sport utility vehicle with which the company hopes to consolidate its position as a producer of quality SUVs. Kia Sportage R The Sportage R, which continues the name that was first introduced in 1991, comes with a choice of 2-liter gasoline or 2-liter diesel engines.The diesel engine generates 184 brake horsepower and manages 15.6 kilometers per liter of fuel. As with the Hyundai Tucson ix, the Sportage R meets the Euro 5 emission standards and has been recognized as a low-emission vehicle, making it exempt from the environmental tax placed on diesel vehicles for five years.Although limited to two vehicles so far, the company has also brought in an alphanumeric naming system that uses the alphabet K followed by a number – 5 and 7.According to Kia, the K represents Kia, Korea, the English word kinetic and the Greek word kratos that means strength.While the meaning of the naming system may be lost on the consumers, the new cars have proved to be boons for the company.Of the two K-series cars, the K5 mid-sized sedan is having perhaps the largest impact on the local market.The company received thousands of pre-launch orders for the vehicle, and its launch appears to be affecting the sales of even the perennial bestseller Hyundai Sonata. Following the K5’s launch last month, monthly Sonata sales fell below 10,000 units for the first time since the car was launched in September.As with the Hyundai Sonata, the K5 is available with either the 2-liter Theta II gasoline engine or the 2.4-liter gasoline direct injection engine.Both versions manage 13 kilometers per liter of fuel.In addition to the two gasoline engines, a liquefied petroleum gas-powered engine for taxis and other special cases. The K5 LPi is the country’s first to be equipped with idle stop and go system that automatically shuts down the engine when idling to reduce fuel consumption.While sales figures fall short of that of the K5, the K7 large sedan is also making its mark in the domestic market.Available with a 2.4-, 2.7- or 3.5-liter engine, the K7 marks Kia’s comeback into the segment in more than a decade.The 2.4-liter engine puts out 180 brake horsepower and manages 11.8 kilometers per liter of fuel, while the 2.7-liter engine generates 200 brake horsepower and manages 11 kilometers per liter.The largest 3.5-liter engine puts out 290 brake horsepower and manages 10.6 kilometers per liter of fuel.In developing the K7, Kia applied some of the latest technologies and boosted safety features.The car comes with vehicle dynamic control system as standard across the range and is available with up to eight airbags.The 2.4 and 2.7 models come with amplitude selective damper as standard, while the 3.5 version is fitted with electronic control suspension as standard equipment for improved ride quality.In addition to such common features, the K7 comes with a number of refinements including the Welcoming System that switches on the lights in the door handle when the driver who possesses the smart key for the vehicle comes within range.By Choi He-suk  (cheesuk@heraldm.com)"
Samsung Electronics Announces Fourth Quarter and FY 2019 Results,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002082076?sid=105,"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 09:15:00 +0900","- Reports quarterly operating profit of KRW 7.16 trillion on sales of KRW 59.88 trillion   By Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, January 30, 2020- Samsung Electronics today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019 and the fiscal year 2019. The Company posted KRW 59.88 trillion in consolidated quarterly revenue and KRW 7.16 trillion in quarterly operating profit.   For 2019, Samsung reported KRW 230.40 trillion in revenue and KRW 27.77 trillion in operating profit.   Fourth quarter profit dropped from a year earlier due to the continued fall in memory chip prices and weakness in display panels. Improving demand for memory used in servers and mobile products, as well as solid sales of flagship smartphones, helped ease the decline in overall earnings.   The Memory Business reported a year-on-year decline in profit as DRAM prices continued its downward trend despite rising shipments. However, earnings increased from the previous quarter, underpinned by increasing demand from data centers and other major applications as well as cost reduction. The logic chip business posted a YoY profit growth on demand for high-resolution image sensors and HPC (high performance computing) chips.   The Display Panel Business suffered weak demand for some premium mobile screens and saw widened losses from the large panel business.   Quarterly earnings improved significantly for the Mobile Business in annual terms, thanks to solid sales of flagship Galaxy smartphones and lineup changes to improve profitability for mass-market models. Profit fell from the previous quarter, however, due to the fading effect from a new flagship product launch.   The Consumer Electronics Business also reported a YoY increase in earnings, led by growing sales of premium products including QLED TVs and new appliance offerings.   In the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects weak sales from seasonality in memory chips, OLED and consumer electronics.   The seasonal effects will likely limit profits in the Memory Business while the outlook is also negative for the Display Panel Business due to slowing demand.   First quarter profit from the Mobile Business is seen steady quarter-on-quarter, as new flagship and foldable models will improve sales but incur additional marketing costs.   Looking ahead to 2020, Samsung expects improvements in overall business performance but also sees continued uncertainties in the global business environment.    Memory market conditions will likely improve gradually thanks to increasing demand from data center companies and 5G smartphone adoption. However, the actual pace of 5G expansion and its effects on DRAM content remain to be seen. The Company expects inventory to return to levels seen in previous years within the first half of this year and will focus on transitioning to the next-generation chip production; 1Z-nm DRAM process and 6th-generation V-NAND.   The System LSI Business will offer differentiated 5G System-on-Chip products and high-resolution sensors. The Foundry Business plans to expand production from the 5nm and 7nm EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) processes while working on developing next-generation 3nm GAA (gate-all-around) technology. In Displays, Samsung will prioritize on responding to growing adoption of OLED and folding screens.   The Mobile Business aims to improve profits by expanding sales of premium models, such as the enhanced 5G lineup and new foldable devices. The Network Business will focus on addressing the global 5G market as its Korean business is set to shrink following last year’s nationwide 5G adoption.   In the Consumer Electronics Division, the Company will seek to increase sales of QLED 8K TVs and launch new premium appliances such as Bespoke and new lifestyle models.   Samsung Electronics’ capital expenditure in 2019 totaled at KRW 26.9 trillion, including KRW 22.6 trillion spent on semiconductors and KRW 2.2 trillion on displays. In 2020, the Company will be flexible in capex execution to meet changing demand from markets, while continuing investment in infrastructure and mid- to long- term business opportunities.   ◆Weakness Looms After Semiconductor Demand Rises in Fourth Quarter   The Semiconductor businesses posted KRW 16.79 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.45 trillion in operating profit in the fourth quarter.   The Memory Business saw solid market demand in the fourth quarter, led by growing demand from server customers. Demand for major applications like those related to 5G network expansions also contributed to gains. On a quarterly basis, earnings improved on cost reduction from process migration and increased sales of differentiated products.   The Company also exceeded its shipment volume guidance for the fourth quarter on proactive responses to demand for all applications.    In the case of DRAM, server demand increased primarily centered on high-density products as datacenters, as well as customers in China boosted orders as a result of new CPU adoption. For mobile, the growing sophistication of mid-to-high end smartphones drove up content per handset in addition to positives linked to 5G network expansions. For PC, negative issues like a CPU shortage were offset by an increase in set-builds at OEM customers, keeping purchasing demand solid.    For NAND, demand was higher than expected thanks to new smartphone launches generating orders for high density models. Increased demand for SSD from server applications also helped performance.   In the first quarter of 2020, overall DRAM demand is seen softening on seasonal effects, although some purchases for mobile and server applications will remain relatively solid. The Company aims to reinforce its cost competitiveness by expanding node migration to 1Y-nm-scale products and utilizing its flexible product mix to respond to demand for high density products.    Also in the January-March period, NAND prices are expected to keep rising mainly on server demand as the market stabilizes. To boost profitability and competitiveness, the Company plans to accelerate the migration process to 6th generation V-NAND in the first half of 2020.   In 2020 on a whole, server demand for DRAM is seen solid on the back of increased investments by data centers. For mobile, the pace of 5G expansion and its effects should be monitored closely but the Company sees demand picking up around mass-market models as major manufacturers expand their 5G smartphone lineups. Construction of 5G networks in China will also drive demand for consumer products this year.   In the case of NAND, server SSD demand from data centers is expected to continue growing this year while the expansion of 5G networks may reinforce the high-density memory demand for mobile devices. The Company also expects new demand from applications such as gaming and automotive.    Meanwhile, earnings for the System LSI Business declined on-quarter as the peak season for mobile handsets faded. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company plans to maximize shipments of major components like APs, image sensors and DDIs adopted by Samsung’s major customers for new flagship smartphones.    In 2020, the System LSI Business plans to expand its 5G chip business by promoting one-chip solutions for mass-market devices. Demand for image sensors is seen rising in 2020 on intensifying competition for better camera specs.   Lastly, the Foundry business saw solid results in the fourth quarter on 5G chips and high-resolution image sensors. Earnings were also helped by demand for HPC chips from Chinese customers. This year, revenue growth is expected to climb and reach double-digits on mass production of 8nm computing chips and demand for 5G related chips.    In 2020, the Company plans on completing the product design for the 4nm process and a number of 5nm-based product designs in order to diversify its customer base and expand applications using Samsung products.    ◆As Earnings Suffer, Display Business to Focus on Securing Profitability   The Display Panel Business posted KRW 8.05 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.22 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter. Overall display earnings decreased QoQ due to weak performance across the business.      Mobile display earnings saw profit decline because of a higher cost burden caused by lower fab utilization amid weaker demand for some premium products. Large displays suffered a bigger loss from a continued decline in LCD panel prices.   Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2020, Samsung expects a further drop in mobile displays earnings due to weak demand from some customers. The Company will strive to enhance profitability by offering more panels with distinct designs, expanding its IT product customer base and strengthening price competitiveness.   Large displays are likely to stay in the red owing to stagnant sales amid weak seasonal effects.    In 2020, for the mobile display business, demand for OLED screens is forecast to grow with wider adoption of 5G smartphones despite intensified competition. The Company will make efforts to expand sales and boost utilization with a broader customer base and stronger product competitiveness. Especially, Samsung will seek to actively address demand for new applications such as foldable devices and other IT products.   For large displays, weak earnings are likely to continue this year as panel oversupply persists and conversion efforts for next-generation QD-Display production incur costs. The Company will focus on securing profitability by expanding sales of value-added products such as ultra-large and 8K TV panels and premium monitor panels.    ◆Mobile to Focus on New Flagship and Foldable Models   The IT & Mobile Communications Division (IM) posted KRW 24.95 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 2.52 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2019.   While overall demand for smartphones and tablets increased QoQ as a result of year-end seasonality, revenue for the Mobile Business decreased QoQ as the effect from new flagship model launches faded. However, the profit drop was capped by effective use of marketing expenses for the holiday season and as the profitability of major smartphones including the Galaxy A series held steady.    Looking ahead to the first quarter, weak demand is seen for smartphones and tablets due to low seasonal demand. In these circumstances, Samsung expects smartphone revenue to rise on improved product mix with the launch of new flagship models and foldable smartphones. However, operating profits are expected to remain flat due to higher marketing expenses used to boost flagship smartphone sales.    For the whole of 2020, while demand for 5G smartphones is expected to increase, market competition is also forecast to intensify as manufacturers increasingly adopt high performance components including APs, memory and cameras. In response, the Company plans to differentiate its premium smartphones by expanding 5G adoption and introducing new designs for foldable products.    Furthermore, Samsung will expand its 5G product portfolio and strengthen product competitiveness of mass-market smartphones by quickly adopting innovative technology based on market needs. With these efforts, the Company aims to improve earnings YoY by expanding sales of premium smartphones and enhancing the competitiveness of its mid- to low-end lineup.   As for the Network Business, while total revenue in the fourth quarter decreased QoQ as 5G network adoption in South Korea was concentrated in the first half, 5G revenue increased in overseas markets, including the United States and Japan. For 2020, although 5G business in the domestic market is expected to decline YoY, Samsung will expand 5G network solutions in overseas markets by solidifying its core competencies and increasing cooperation with major business partners.   ◆Premium TVs and Appliances Shine in Fourth Quarter; Risks Mixed Ahead   The Consumer Electronics Division, comprised of the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses, recorded KRW 12.71 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.81 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2019.   In the fourth quarter, earnings for the Visual Display Business improved both QoQ and YoY on the back of successful promotion efforts during the year-end peak season. Sales of QLED TVs and TVs with 75-inches-and-above screens were especially notable, showcasing an improved product mix for the Company.    In particular, QLED TV sales in the fourth quarter exceeded twice the amount sold in the same period a year ago.    However, the Company forecasts market demand in the first quarter to decline QoQ following the year-end peak season, and also YoY due to weaker demand in developed markets.  In 2020 on a whole, the global TV market faces geopolitical risks, but global TV demand is expected to climb thanks to sports events like the UEFA European Football Championship and the Summer Olympic Games.    For the Digital Appliance Business in the fourth quarter, earnings rose on increased demand in emerging markets including India. Revenue and profit both improved YoY as sales of premium products like the Bespoke refrigerator and large dryers grew.   Samsung plans to continue launching new lifestyle digital appliances and premium products to seek growth in the first quarter. For the whole year, the Company sees uncertainties from global economic sluggishness but will aim to offset risks through the expansion of its premium lineup and more B2B opportunities.뉴스채널 설정 - 네이버 메인에서 디지털데일리 뉴스를 볼 수 있어요.IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>		"
Dongbu HiTek Paves Way for CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) Processing at 110nm N...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0000026985?sid=105,"Fri, 14 Sep 2007 11:00:00 +0900","Dongbu HiTek recently announced the availability of a new design library to support the processing of CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) processing at the 110nm node. Highlighting the foundry’s leadership in advancing CIS technology for mobile handset applications, the new library enables low leakage current in standby status as well as up to 5-megapixel resolution in camera phones. The launch of the new 110nm CIS library follows Dongbu HiTek’s April 2007 introduction of a 130nm CIS library. Significantly, both libraries were entirely developed using Dongbu HiTek intellectual property (IP) without any collaboration with EDA vendors. Both libraries are offered at no charge to Dongbu HiTek’s foundry customers. According to Min-Hwan Kim, Senior Manager Dongbu HiTek’s IP Development Team, CIS chips that migrate from the 130nm to the 110nm node can realize up to 30% reduction in feature size, which translates to more useful chips per wafer as well as higher foundry profit margins. He confirmed that the new library was completely developed using Dongbu HiTek’s IP, adding, “We have clearly demonstrated our capability to develop world-class design libraries without involving leading EDA companies such as ARM and Virage Logic.” Joon Hwang, EVP in charge of the CIS Development for Dongbu HiTek noted that only final reliability testing remains to be performed before qualifying the foundry’s 110nm CIS process technology for volume production, and this will be completed over the next few months. “Our 110nm design library combined with our 110nm process technology will enable us to manufacture a wider range of CIS devices for mobile handset applications. By developing essential IP and design libraries early, Dongbu HiTek has positioned itself to provide best-in-class CIS devices for next generation mobile handsets.” [ 관련기사 ]☞  동부하이텍, 110나노급 CIS 라이브러리 독자 개발<저작권자ⓒ디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>"
[Adam Minter] China’s dog meat image problem,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000174731?sid=104,"Sun, 26 Jun 2016 16:22:00 +0900","			I ate dog just once, and it was an accident. A Chinese scrap metal dealer with whom I’m friendly invited me to a fancy hot pot restaurant in Chongqing. As the waitress delivered bowl after bowl of dunkable vegetables and raw meats for cooking at our table, I pointed to one and asked: “What’s this?” My friend’s answer, in heavily accented English, sounded like “duck.” It tasted like a meaty hair ball.As the magnitude of my mistake sank in, I thought of Yulin, the southern Chinese town infamous for its annual dog meat and lychee festival, which opens this week. In recent years, the festival has become synonymous with animal cruelty, attracting celebrity outrage from the likes of Ricky Gervais and Leona Lewis. But it’s also emblematic of a larger failure — one that my unintentional experiment instantly brought to mind. For years, scandals have been undermining confidence in China’s food supply, ranging from plasticizer in baby formula to “poisonous fake mutton” sold to (gulp) hot pot restaurants. In 2014, authorities shut down a decade-old, nationwide ring that had been selling some 70,000 diseased pigs a year to underground slaughterhouses. The dog meat trade offers a vivid example of why these problems are so persistent. Visitors to Yulin’s festival have witnessed dogs being slaughtered on streets or in filthy abattoirs. Many of the animals were likely strays or kidnapped, raising serious concerns about disease. Some may have even had rabies. And yet thousands will be consumed over the 10 days of the festival. That may sound shocking. But with few qualified food inspectors, and plenty of more mainstream worries, regulators aren’t in any hurry to crack down, especially in regions where dog eating is acceptable and contributes to local coffers. The story is much the same at wet markets across China, whether the animal is a dog or a duck. Despite the best intentions of officials in Beijing, the vast scale of China’s agricultural sector — with hundreds of millions of farmers — makes it difficult to monitor. And its economic importance means that local governments are keen to protect it, no matter how abhorrent the practices. Two years ago, I watched as chicken vendors at a Shanghai-area poultry market were tipped off to a bird flu-related culling and simply fled with their animals. Even when regulators have tried to crack down, vendors have wised up. The dog meat industry now cleverly advertises itself as a collection of modern, large-scale breeding operations — even though one study found that those breeders tend to be fronts for unsanitary home operators. Their shady counterparts in the pork business have set up similar schemes. The results are depressing, but not surprising: The dog meat festivals continue, food scandals persist and China’s leaders acknowledge that they have a long, long way to go. It’s not all bad news, however. For one thing, dog meat, never all that popular in China, is becoming less so by the year. Chinese consumers are also increasingly health conscious and willing to spend more for quality food. In time, market forces could have as much of an impact as an army of regulators. Dog lovers, too, have reasons for optimism. In 2009, the government issued a draft animal welfare law. Although it hasn’t yet passed, its mere existence is a remarkable step for a country that was largely agrarian only a generation ago. More humane butchering will, in time, lead to safer butchering. Meanwhile, my friend hasn’t forgotten the look on my face as I unwittingly consumed my one and only bite of dog. “It’s not for everyone,” he told me recently. “But I’m sorry.”By Adam MinterAdam Minter is an American writer based in Asia, where he covers politics, culture, business and junk.

How do S. Korean 20-somethings view young politicians’ rise and fall?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000239753?sid=104,"Sat, 10 Sep 2022 11:02:00 +0900","Lee Jun-seok, the former leader of the ruling People Power Party, speaks at a press conference held in Gwangju, Sunday. Lee is one of the representative young politicians who emerged during the 20th presidential election period eariler this year. (Yonhap)It was during the 20th presidential election that the young generation suddenly surged as a tie-breaking vote, making the two largest parties desperate to entice them.The People Power Party focused on male voters in their 20s -- previously a reliably liberal demographic -- with Lee Jun-seok, who was the youngest party leader in the South Korean history at the time. The Democratic Party recruited Park Ji-hyun, a 26-year-old anti-sex crime activist, to shore up its appeal to young female voters.After the election, however, the political standing of Lee and Park changed drastically. Lee was suspended as allegations of receiving sexual bribery were revealed amid an internal party feud, and Park was denied the chance to register as a candidate for the party leadership.Replaceable accessories""What parties wanted was a simple, obedient token that would bring a young image to the party,"" said Han Soo-bin, a 25-year-old graduate student. All they have done so far -- or have been allowed to do so far -- was just repeating the claims of older politicians with a younger mask, she said.Jang Mi, a 23-year-old college student, said she feels like young politicians were considered no more than “a simple accessory to add a fresh, young image to ossified parties.”“Apart from the qualification and capability of the individual young figures, the overall attitudes of the older politicians and the press which assess them are seriously outdated.” They considered young figures as a simple disguise to lure young voters, she added.“It is true that several young politicians had shown many shortcomings and flaws, but newcomers cannot grow into competent politicians within the current system that does not tolerate people until they mature,” continued Jang.Kwon Su-min, a 24-year-old office worker, had similar thoughts.“(Young politicians) were not introduced to the party by proving themselves to be useful politicians. They were just a marketing strategy.”Kim Hyun-woo, in his early 20s, used similar description, “a high-selling political product.”“To use them as an embodiment of youth and innovation, parties will come up with another young politician when necessary. But when they don’t behave, they will be kicked out again,” said Kim.They don’t represent all of usSome people said that the concept of “young politicians” itself is questionable.What is the standard for being a young politician? And do they really represent younger voters?“Politicians should represent every citizen evenly, but young politicians now are unequally distributed in both age and gender. For example, there are no representative leftist young male politicians that I can think of,” said a 22-year-old college student who wished to stay anonymous.“What’s worse is that this imbalance distorted images of young generations. All men in their 20s are believed to be conservatives and while women are believed to be progressive, but this dichotomy is clearly wrong.”Another 22-year-old, surnamed Lee says that the term “young politicians” is a term used by older generations, as such figures are described as “young” simply because they are younger than more established politicians.Others say that these fresh faces in politics do not necessarily represent the interests of those in similar age groups, and that the parties’ use of younger figures leads to oversights.“Simply letting people take important political positions just because they are young is not ‘young politics.’ That way, only the ones who imitate and follow old politicians will get a chance. Rather than that, I believe politicians with a certain amount of influence and critical mind will be helpful, apart from their physical ages,” said 25-year-old Hwang Min-hyeok.Others appear fatigued by the way younger, more high-profile politicians are recruited, and called for such individuals to be vetted for their capabilities, rather than simply based on the public appeal they may have.We need inclusivenessAlthough many showed skepticism toward young politicians, most 20-somethings The Korea Herald spoke to agreed that change was necessary.Kim Yong-hyun, 24, pointed out the lopsided landscape of politics as a major problem. “Politics must always reform itself. It does not mean that they should unconditionally lower the average age of politicians but means that we should end the monopolization of a certain generation.”A 22-year-old who wished to stay anonymous said the self-righteous attitude of older politicians was the main obstacle to achieving an inclusive political environment.“The older generation disparages young people as inexperienced, but at the same time they also demand perfection. It’s such a waste that all attempts at something new are perceived negatively,” they said.A graduate student called Han called for further inclusiveness, not just in terms of age but also in terms of ideology, social status and so on. “It is true that Korean politics should include younger figures than the current state, but before that, building an inclusive political environment should be the ultimate goal.”This inclusiveness, however, is not the task solely for the older generations. It should be multilateral, said Kwon. “Young people haven’t experienced traumatic events that make up large parts of older generations’ memories, such as war and military dictatorship. Politics must embrace every member of a country, so we also need to make efforts to understand them.”“Regardless of political orientation, it is necessary to survive in the political arena for a considerable amount of time to draw meaningful social changes, but it looks like people who speak straightforwardly and differently cannot survive in Korean politics for long. We really need a more inclusive, open-minded political environment,” added Kwon."

Hip generation charmed by LG design renaissance,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000054524,"Thu, 17 Nov 2005 10:02:00 +0900","			 Good management is not only about managing the workforce, but also about keeping up with the times to ensure that the company is aligned with current consumer demands.For electronics makers like LG, that means to be aware that tech-savvy buyers today are obsessed with visual impact. Mobile phones and other electronic gadgets have transcended into fashion statements for trendsetters.""We`re living in an age where great design spells competitiveness,"" says Lim On-suk, a consultant at Oricom Institute of Brand Strategy.LG is acutely aware of the importance of design, Lim says, which is why the company is so focused on catering to the metamorphosing desires of younger consumers.""You notice that armed with cooler and more stylish designs, LG is increasingly targeting the younger consumer,"" said Lim.This year, LG Electronics rolled out half a dozen new models of mobile phones.In May, it introduced its DMB mobile phone with a top cover that rotates 360 degrees. Users with its up-and-down sliding phone can open the phone by simply pushing the lid upwards and then sliding it shut again afterwards.The new sports car phone, shaped like a sporting vehicle, is another innovation. In addition to the stylish design, the phone can even calculate alcohol-intake of the user to help prevent drinking and driving.On the management level, the company is deploying new campaigns such as design contests to help motivate workers into rolling out better and savvier products.Personnel support is included as LG Electronics plans to double its number of in-house designers to 600. Through overseas design labs, the company will seek to create designs catering to the on-the-spot consumers.As a part of its blueprint to push its design facilities and personnel to global levels, the electronics maker operates design labs in the United States, Japan, China, India and Italy.""A strong designing division is one of the crucial elements for driving LG Electronics up to one of the top three in the world,"" said Lee Hee-gook, the company`s CTO.Cultural sense   As it is catapulted to the rank of a global brand, LG Electronics says it has become more aware that a great company bears social and cultural obligations that run beyond churning out top-notch goods.Echoing these views, the electronics maker has been aggressively seeking to add a cultural touch to its business operations by sponsoring various cultural and educational events and television programs all over the globe.LG Electronics currently sponsors an on-air quiz show - ""Digital LG Quiz"" - in eight nations; Russia, Morocco, Vietnam, China, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Panama and the Philippines.""Digital LG Quiz"" has been hotly received by local audiences, and the program is getting ample attention as one of the best education programs on air.LG Electronics also began supporting The Wiltern Theater, a historical arts center in Los Angeles, California since 2003.Established in 1931, The Wiltern Theater draws nearly 300,000 visitors every year, and is recognized as a Historical Cultural Monument by the City of Los Angeles. It has been renamed the Wiltern LG in recognition of the support given by the company.LG Electronics has additionally helped this cultural venue by refurnishing it with new digital gadgets including the plasma display panel TVs, also providing the visitors opportunities to become acquainted with its line of high quality products.This sponsorship is aimed to help create a positive corporate image for LG, in addition to publicizing the company products.Korean businesses have often limited themselves to sponsoring sports events, but supporting a cultural venue like Wiltern LG is unprecedented, and it is expected to establish a close relationship between LG and Korean Americans living in the Los Angeles area.In New York City, LG Electronics took part in the world-famous ""New York Fashion Week"" last September as one of the sponsors for the event - others included Mercedes Bentz and American Express.""New York Fashion Week"" takes place every September amid international publicity, and premier-fashion retailers like Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Perry Ellis participate in this event to show off their latest wardrobes.Both international and local opinion leaders also take part in this event to get a taste of upcoming fashion trends.LG Electronics had been able to play a part in this, first because it had been acknowledged by both the U.S. and European markets for its high-quality products with chic designs.In Russia and China, LG Electronics has launched ""LG festival"" for small-city residents, organizing cultural performances and music contests, in addition to making financial gifts to the municipal governments.Particularly in Russia, the company made special efforts to localize the LG brand name, hosting a number of cultural events including ""Miss LG contest,"" ""LG karaoke,"" and ""LG children`s painting contest."" The events are rising in popularity - making them success cases of effective cultural marketing.In Prague, Czech Republic, LG Electronics organized the second ""LG Advant Concert"" in 2004 for Cezh youths, which was held at the nation`s presidential palace. Nearly 500 people were present including President Vaclav Klaus and his wife, and the mayor of Prague, Pavel Bem.Central Asia is also the global consumer electronics company`s marketing arena. Last March in Kazakhstan, LG Electronics launched ""Korean Fims festival"" in Dom Kino Theater in the capital city of Almaty, where Korean traditional dance was performed, in addition to showing the blockbuster movies; ""Taegukgi; Brotherhood of War""; ""Old Boy""; and ""R-Point."" The festival drew nearly 3,000, including the vice-mayor of Almaty Vokash Galym.This is the first Korean film festival ever held in Kazakhstan. This is part of a larger role that LG Electronics has played in disseminating Korean culture in the Central Asian nation.It took on the active parts in broadcasting Korean TV dramas such as ""First Love,"" ""Invitation"" and ""Autumn Fairytale"" in the local stations. The company also organized ""The second Kazak Karaoke Festival,"" a talent show in which 16 final contestants competed for the prize.The karaoke festival was designed to aid the Kazak government`s current endeavors in preserving the national language. LG Electronics developed a Kazak-language karaoke disc to promote for its continued efforts in this respect.(jemmie@heraldm.com) (jpark731@heraldm.com)  By Kim Ji-hyun and Park Jung-youn  "
U.S. must reverse its image as apologist,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000104104?sid=104,"Fri, 11 Feb 2011 19:16:00 +0900","			 While much attention focuses on how gracefully to dislodge President Hosni Mubarak from his 30-year reign, the Obama administration should be asking how U.S. policies helped him remain in office that long to begin with. The United States has grown far too comfortable with an Arab world dominated by unmovable, abusive rulers while assuming that the Arab people couldn’t be trusted with democracy.U.S. support for pro-Western oppressors may have helped curb Islamist influences, assure a steady flow of oil and keep Israel secure. But disastrous consequences now are resulting from America’s decision to compromise its fundamental democratic principles for the expediency of the iron fist.Egyptians want democracy badly enough to die for it. Instead of an unqualified voice of support from Washington, what the protesters perceive are U.S. stalling tactics aimed at buying Mubarak a few more months in power.Unless the United States takes a more vocal lead in helping the protesters achieve their goal, the next generation of Arab leaders cannot be blamed for turning their backs on America altogether. Washington should focus less on shoring up its credibility with dictators than building credibility with those who want to end the Arab world’s long era of oppressive rule.Al-Qaida and other Islamist groups have long opposed the spread of democracy in the Middle East. So whose interests ultimately are served by a U.S. policy favoring monarchs and dictators over democratic leadership? Arabs must be given the opportunity to choose for themselves, as frightening as this might sound to Westerners. Yes, there is a danger that they could use the vote to elect Islamists. But Egyptian protesters say that, having fought this hard to uproot Mubarak, they have no intention of replacing him with an Iran-style government of mullahs.Some examples, such as the Palestinians’ choice of the Islamist Hamas over the secular but corrupt leadership of Fatah, fuel the impression that Arabs aren’t ready for full democracy. But in Iraq, voters experimented with Islamist leadership, and when those representatives failed to deliver on their populist promises of jobs and improved services, voters subsequently ousted them. That’s exactly how the system should work.There is no one-size-fits-all approach to facilitating a democratic transition. What works for Egypt might not work for Saudi Arabia or Jordan. But it’s clear that the Arab street is fed up with oppression, corruption and human rights abuses that occur while Washington looks the other way. Their autocratic rulers are pushing the region toward increasing chaos, not stability. And Tuesday’s mass gathering in Cairo should dispel any notion that the protests are going to die down soon.This is a messy and unpredictable process. But if America truly stands for democracy, Washington must abandon the double standard that prevents Arabs from practicing it.(The Dallas Morning News, Feb. 9)"
Rules changing as Korea-U.S. alliance turns 70,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000037618?sid=100,"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 19:01:00 +0900","  Korean and U.S. Air Force pilots conduct a joint drill at Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, last month. Seen in the backdrop is an A-10 subsonic attack aircraft. [KOREAN AIR FORCE]           ━          Partnership as relevant as ever, but can’t be taken for granted       Alliance at year 70: First in a four-part series     In light of the shifting geopolitical situation and growing risk factors in the region, the alliance between South Korea and the United States has transformed and evolved over the past 70 years. The Korea-U.S. alliance now stands at a crossroads as it marks its 70th anniversary and the relationship advances into a more global and comprehensive partnership. In a four-part series, the Korea JoongAng Daily will examine the various challenges faced by the allies in terms of diplomatic, security, economic and people-to-people cooperation and discuss possible ways forward. – Ed.   The South Korea-U.S. alliance — often described as one of the most successful of its kind — has faced, and overcome, many trials and tribulations over the past seven decades.    Since coming into office, Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol placed relations with the United States as a top priority in a shift away from the previous administration, which sought a more balanced approach with China.    During their first summit in Seoul on May 21, Yoon and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to upgrade bilateral relations to a ""global comprehensive strategic alliance.”    The two sides agreed to further broaden the traditional security alliance, dating back to their 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty, to encompass economic and technological cooperation.    In the face of a growing geopolitical divide reminiscent of the Cold War era, Seoul and Washington celebrate the 70th anniversary of their alliance this year, highlighted by Yoon’s state visit to the United States this week.    But is the relationship really “ironclad” today, as both sides say it is?      “The alliance remains as relevant today as it was in the 1950s,” said Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center and former CIA deputy division chief for Korea. “Since its inception, the alliance has both enjoyed smooth sailing and suffered through squalls brought on by the actions of one country or the other. But the alliance endured because it was in the strategic interests of both countries to maintain their ties.”    Experts point out that while the alliance isn’t going away anytime soon, gone are the days that it can be taken for granted.    Leading scholars on alliance affairs in Korea and the United States weighed in that while Seoul-Washington security ties are enduring on the surface, they can be more fragile than it appears, taking into consideration the evolving geopolitical situation, the intensifying U.S.-China strategic competition and growing North Korea threats, in addition to domestic political factors.    South Korea can no longer expect the United States to unconditionally step in — whether it comes to extended deterrence, maintaining the full force of U.S. troops on the peninsula or economic security matters.    Instead, the alliance is evolving into a more nuanced relationship, one where reciprocity is needed in order to become more balanced partners on the global stage.    “There is much to celebrate as the Republic of Korea (ROK) and U.S. governments transform their Cold War alliance into a future-oriented ‘global comprehensive strategic alliance,’” said Andrew Yeo, senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation Chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies and professor of politics at The Catholic University of America, “but it also brings some challenges and likely some growing pains.”      President Yoon Suk Yeol, right, looks at U.S. President Joe Biden at a joint press conference after their first bilateral summit at the presidential office in Yongsan, central Seoul, on May 21, 2022. [JOINT PRESS CORPS]      Hurdles faced by the alliance   Despite the two allies’ “seamless” military alliance, Koreans face fears of abandonment by the United States amid the shifting geopolitical situation and the growing unpredictability of North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats.    Such persistent distrust and anxieties were further fueled by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s multiple threats to pull or reduce U.S. troops in allied countries and withdraw the American nuclear umbrella over the region, causing Koreans to become increasingly anxious that the alliance may not be as infallible as they once believed.    The Yoon administration, from its onset in May last year, stressed that the Korea-U.S. alliance is back and stronger than ever.      Biden also has emphasized that the United States will be prioritizing its allies again, in an apparent turnaround from the “America First” rhetoric of the Trump administration.    But Seoul’s woes continued with the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, which are concerning to Korean automakers and chipmakers.    Recently, leaked classified Pentagon documents indicated that U.S. intelligence authorities may have been spying on allied countries, including Korean presidential aides’ internal deliberations on supplying military aid to Ukraine in the war with Russia.    Some of these issues are expected to be tackled in Yoon’s bilateral summit with Biden in Washington on April 26, the first such state visit in 12 years.    The state visit is primarily to mark the 70th anniversary of the alliance but could be an occasion to discuss aligning the two countries’ Indo-Pacific strategies, coordinating North Korea policy and addressing cooperation for economic security and supply chain stability.    It comes as the United States has been making it clear that it wants its allies to pick sides amid the intensifying strategic competition which seems to pit U.S.-led democracies against rising authoritarian rule. The division comes amid the growing U.S.-China rivalry, Russia’s war with Ukraine and North Korea’s escalated missile and nuclear pursuits.    Experts point out that Seoul could do more to stick up for the Indo-Pacific region out of its own volition, rather than only when Washington prods at its back.    “When the principles, values and sovereignty of Indo-Pacific nations are under attack, one would hope South Korea would, on its own, implement measures to defend them rather than depicting them as ‘U.S. demands for anti-China coalitions,’” said Klingner. “Other nations, such as Japan and Australia, have been far bolder than South Korea in calling out China for its transgressions against its neighbors and domestic human rights violations.”    Similarly, he noted South Korea “lagged behind other nations” in its initial response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year.    Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, pointed out that South Korea has until recently shied away from U.S.-led groupings meant to strengthen solidarity in the Indo-Pacific region that might “offend” China.    “It was an appeasement policy to China in order to enable an engagement policy with North Korea that had the effect of isolating South Korea among the democracies in Asia,” said Cha.    “It has now become impossible to strike a balance between the United States and China,” said Prof. Kim Hyun-wook, director-general of the Department of American Studies at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy (KDNA). “The United States has now become a country busy taking care of its own interests, that has to promote ‘America first.’ In the past, even if Korea raised complaints against the United States, it was always steadfast as an ally, but we are not dealing with that United States anymore.”    He warned that Seoul has been relegated to a “second-tier ally” during its period of hesitance, positioning itself between Beijing and Washington over the past several Korean administrations.    Kim said now is the time for Korea to “make a choice” between the United States and China.    “When it comes to the Korea-U.S. alliance, we still have this image in our minds that the United States will protect us and provides us with security, and forever be our ally no matter what,” Kim said. “It’s now time to change that perception of being a patron ally.”    He said Koreans “need to slightly lower our expectations of the United States,” and stop reminiscing of the days of America’s enormous economic power during the past Cold War era, with its unlimited capacity to provide military and economic support to Europe and Asia.    “The United States has become such a country that we have to negotiate and compromise with,” Kim said. “We need to examine what our core and vital interests are, as well as the interests of the United States, and find a process in which we can compromise and share them, because a unilateral alliance where we do things just because the United States tells us to won’t last very long.”    With a similar message, Yoon in a Cabinet meeting on April 18 said that the Korea-U.S. alliance ""is not a relationship swayed by interests, but one based on the universal values of a liberal democracy and market economy.”    He stressed that the two countries “are a resilient value-based alliance that can fully adjust even if there is a conflict of interest or a problem arises,” in reference to the U.S. wiretapping allegations.

[JOONGANG PHOTO]         The forging of an alliance     Last year, the two allies marked the 140th anniversary of diplomatic ties, dating back to the signing of the the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation between the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) and the United States.    But the alliance between Seoul and Washington took shape in the modern sense with the arrival of U.S. troops in Korea after World War II and the U.S. military's participation in the three-year Korean War, which ended with an armistice agreement on July 27, 1953.    The United States sent 1.79 million troops, the largest number among those nations participating in the war through the UN Command, and 37,000 American soldiers were killed.    On Oct. 1, 1953, the Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty was signed in Washington, establishing an official military alliance. Through the treaty, which entered into force on Nov. 18, 1954, the two countries could jointly defend against external armed attacks, and the United States stationed its troops in South Korea in its defense.    It was the fourth security pact negotiated by the United States with an Asia-Pacific nation — after Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Japan.    Seoul and Washington in the treaty recognized their “common determination to defend themselves against external armed attack so that no potential aggressor could be under the illusion that either of them stands alone in the Pacific area.”    They called to strengthen their efforts for “collective defense for the preservation of peace and security.    “South Korea, like any country reliant on another for a portion of its security, will be nervous about the commitment of its ally,” Klingner said. “But the allies have remained shoulder to shoulder for 70 years, not only out of tradition and honor, but out of necessity. The North Korean threat remains today, with even greater weapons of devastation.”    Korea has come a long way from its days as a war-torn country completely dependent on the United States for defense, through its rapid economic development and political transition from authoritarianism to democracy.    Despite hitting rough patches along the way, including a surge in anti-American sentiment after a U.S. Army vehicle hit and killed two Korean middle school girls in 2002 and massive protests over a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) signed in 2007, the two countries have emerged as mutually beneficial partners sharing similar values and interests.    In 2009, the two countries upgraded their relations to a “comprehensive strategic alliance” of bilateral, regional and global scope.    The FTA took effect in 2012 and has served beyond a basic framework for economic cooperation and a symbol of expanding bilateral trade.    “No alliance of the United States has transformed more in the modern era than that with Korea,” Cha said. “Korea went from being one of the poorest countries in the world to an OECD Development Assistance Committee [DAC] country within one generation.”      “The establishment of United States Forces Korea [USFK], in its Combined Forces Command format, means that the integration of the U.S. and ROK military is extremely tight, arguably the tightest in the world, between two alliance partners,” said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “There are no two major militaries as closely interoperable as the U.S. and South Korean militaries. And that was not always the case.”    Today, South Korea is sixth strongest military and the 10th largest economy in the world.    And the alliance is just as important, if not more so, than it was 70 years ago, not only for the defense of South Korea but for international solidarity. Seoul has leveraged its global standing, with a series of invitations to multilateral forums such as the NATO summit in Spain in June last year and the upcoming G7 summit in Hiroshima next month.    Korea’s soft power has grown as well, especially with its cultural and social influence through K-pop and entertainment content.    “Korea, although still a junior partner in the alliance, is much more capable than before, and the gap to the power with the United States is smaller than in previous generations,” said Richey. “So the two alliance partners have become more equal […] and Korea has become a much more meaningful partner to the United States because of its soft power growth and economic growth.”    Transition to a global partnership   In a joint statement last May, Yoon and Biden announced the upgrading of Korea-U.S. relations to a global comprehensive strategic alliance “firmly rooted in the shared values of promoting democracy and the rules-based international order, fighting corruption, and advancing human rights.”    They broadened coordination in military and security affairs to shared values and economic and technological cooperation, especially in light of the transformation of the international trade order and the disruption of global supply chains.    “The U.S.-South Korea alliance was intended to deter North Korea and defend South Korea from another invasion,” said Brookings Institution’s Yeo. “Since then, the alliance has expanded in function and scope over the past 70 years,” covering a broad range of traditional and non-traditional security issues including extended deterrence, missile defense, supply chain resilience, artificial intelligence, space cooperation, health, climate change, development finance and economic security.    Yeo said that although bilateral alliances in Asia were “created as part of a U.S. ‘power play’ to keep in check smaller allies, the South Korean government today exercises a much greater role and responsibility in the alliance decision-making process.”    He noted that the scope of the alliance has “geographically expanded over time to cover issues outside the defense of the Korean Peninsula.”    “The new moniker for the alliance is both a recognition of South Korea’s already extensive global role, as well as a pledge for even greater commitments by Seoul,” said Klingner. “President Yoon declared that South Korea will become a global pivotal state. But South Korea has already long punched above its weight on the diplomatic, economic and societal stage, and its forces have fought alongside the United States far from the Korean Peninsula.”    Klingner said that the Yoon administration’s new Indo-Pacific strategy and Seoul’s pledge to uphold the rule of law and protect the principles shared by democracies is “commendable.”    The Yoon administration has distanced itself from the preceding Moon Jae-in administration’s peace initiative focused on diplomacy with North Korea.    Last December, the Yoon administration announced its strategy for a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, its version of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy, widely seen as one of Biden’s initiatives to contain China’s rising assertiveness in the region.      Other similar U.S. coalitions include those involving Seoul, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and the so-called Chip 4 alliance with South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, among the United States, Japan, Australia and India — of which Korea is not a part.    Cha welcomed Yoon’s recent diplomatic overtures to Tokyo to resolve the issue of compensation of Japan’s wartime forced labor victims. He noted this move opened up opportunities for Seoul’s participation in Quad, G7, and other groupings “that make South Korea stronger vis-à-vis China, North Korea, Russia.”    On March 16, Yoon held a bilateral summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, attempting to improve frayed ties due to a historical dispute and a trade spat, which comes as Washington has pushed for stronger trilateral cooperation with its East Asian allies.    “At the core, I believe this is an ‘ironclad’ alliance that goes beyond just security threats and economic interests, but is also connected by personal ties and through common values and principles,” Yeo said.    “It would be difficult for the U.S. to pursue supply chain resilience or economic security without Korea’s cooperation,” he added. “However, the Yoon government recognizes that by not joining other like-minded allies and partners, it loses out on an opportunity to shape regional economic order and may find itself at a disadvantageous position in the long run.”    Such shifts in the alliance “mean that Korea has become a much more integral and valuable partner to the U.S. in supporting regional peace and stability and a rules-based liberal international order,” Yeo said.    American experts noted that there is generally bipartisan backing of the alliance within the Congress, while in Korea there is a stronger conservative-leaning support.    Nonetheless, “deeper polarization in U.S. politics has brought a greater element of uncertainty with U.S. foreign policy,” Yeo pointed out.      Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, right, and U.S. President Joe Biden toast each other at an official dinner at the National Museum of Korea in central Seoul on May 21, 2022. [PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE]      Future direction of the alliance   “Think where man’s glory most begins and ends. And say my glory was I had such friends.”    Yoon quoted the passage from W.B. Yeats’ (1865-1939) poem, “The Municipal Gallery Revisited,” during the official dinner hosted for Biden at the National Museum of Korea on May 21.    The Irish poet is widely known as a favorite of the U.S. president, and Biden stressed, “Revitalizing this alliance was one of my key foreign policy priorities when I took office last year.”    Calling for the flourishing of the alliance for the decades to come, Biden said, “We go together,” the well-known motto of the Combined Forces Command that is symbolic of the long-standing Korea-U.S. alliance.    But seven decades since the signing of the mutual defense treaty, are the two allies as inseparable and unified in all aspects as their militaries appear to be?    “It is my view that the U.S. will never abandon Korea,” Cha said. “Japan will always be a U.S. ally. China will always be a competitor of sorts. That makes Korea the crucial piece. If the U.S. loses Korea, it loses Asia.”    He added just as Koreans may still fear U.S. abandonment, some Americans also worry that Koreans may bail out on the United States over issues such as a Taiwan contingency, noting that the two allies “need to reassure each other.”    But an eventual reduction of American troops stationed in Korea is not out of question.    “The complete abandonment of the alliance is unlikely anywhere in the near future,” Yeo said. “There may be a day when the U.S. and ROK decide that security on the Korean Peninsula and in the region may not require all 28,500 troops, and we may see some reductions if the security environment changes and peace and stability are achieved on the Korean Peninsula. But even in the scenario of Korean unification, I believe the alliance will still exist.”    Experts generally weighed in that Korea may have to step up its game both to make the bilateral alliance more enduring and for its own survival as it may increasingly need to play a vital role in the ongoing Sino-U.S. competition.    “The time has come for Korea to play a leadership role in the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy,” said Kim. “Korea has to play a leading role in forming the norms, together with the United States. We can't just be a follower like we are now; we have to become the rule setters.”    Kim likewise pointed out that Koreans need to be “prepared for a scenario where U.S. hegemony declines” and the number of U.S. troops on the peninsula is “drastically reduced,” which is where arguments for Seoul’s nuclear armament come into play.    “The larger geopolitical geostrategic issues in East Asia today mean that the alliance is relevant for regional stability and security architecture in East Asia,” Richey said.    He noted that South Korea is “an important component of an overall U.S. balancing strategy,” referring to U.S. attempts to balance China's regional advantages in East Asia.    “Obviously, the U.S. will remain South Korea's security guarantor, there's no dispute — there's no possibility that that's going to change in the short- or medium-term future,” Richey said. But he advised Korea to “look more aggressively at diversifying its partners,” in order to lessen its dependence on one country economically.    “The U.S. abandoning its alliance with South Korea would be a reckless impertinent act that violates American commitments, values and bedrock principles,” Klingner said. Such action would have “severely dire consequences for America’s reputation” and its other allies and partnerships.    “One would hope that eventually the military necessity of the alliance would wither away once the North Korean threat disappears and the Korean Peninsula is peacefully reunited based on the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law,” Klingner added. “But, until that day, the alliance will remain crucial for the defense of South Korea and in the strategic interests of the United States.”   "

By utilizing both hardware and software, hybrid face detection enables realistic face-tracking filters as well as stronger security when unlocking a device with one’s face. For added security, the processor has a separate security processing unit to safeguard vital personal data such as facial, iris and fingerprint information.The LTE modem in the Exynos 9810 makes it much easier to broadcast or stream videos at up to UHD resolution, or in even newer visual formats such as 360-degree video. Following the successful launch of the industry’s first 1.0 gigabits per second (Gbps) LTE modem last year, Samsung again leads the industry with the first 1.2Gbps LTE modem embedded in Exynos 9810. It’s also the industry’s first Cat.18 LTE modem to support up to 6x carrier aggregation (CA) for 1.2Gbps downlink and 200 megabits per second (Mbps) uplink. Compared to its predecessor’s 5CA, this new modem delivers more stable data transfers at blazing speed. To maximize the transfer rate, the modem supports a 4x4 MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) and 256-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) scheme, and utilizes enhanced Licensed-Assisted Access (eLAA) technology. Not only will multimedia experiences on mobile devices with Exynos 9810 be faster, but they will also be more immersive, thanks to a dedicated image processing and upgraded multi-format codec (MFC). With faster and more energy-efficient image and visual processing, users will see advanced stabilization for images and video of up to UHD resolution, real-time out-of-focus photography in high resolution and brighter pictures in low light with reduced noise and motion blur. The upgraded MFC supports video recording and playback at up to UHD resolution at 120 frames per second (fps). With 10-bit HEVC (high efficiency video coding) and VP9 support, the MFC can render 1,024 different tones for each primary color (red, green and blue). This translates to a vast 1.07 billion possibilities of colors, or 64 times the previous 8-bit color format’s 16.7 million. With a much wider color range and more accurate color fidelity, users will be able to create and enjoy highly immersive content. The Exynos 9 Series 9810 is currently in mass production.IT언론의 새로운 대안[디지털데일리]IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드[딜라이트닷넷]윤상호(crow@ddaily.co.kr)<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>		"
Samsung Electronics Announces Fourth Quarter \& FY 2017 Results,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002058680?sid=105,"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 10:05:00 +0900","- Registers 4Q net profit of KRW 12.26 trillion on sales of KRW 65.98 trillion 4Q consolidated operating profit reaches KRW 15.15 trillionBy Yun Sang-hocrow@ddaily.co.kr[Digital Daily]Seoul, Korea, January 31, 2018- Samsung Electronics posted KRW 65.98 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 15.15 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017.Overall, the company reported full-year revenue of KRW 239.58 trillion and full-year operating profit of KRW 53.65 trillion.Fourth quarter earnings were driven by the components business, with the largest contribution coming from the Memory business that manufactures DRAM and NAND, as orders for high-performance memory products for servers and mobile storage were strong. However, weak seasonality impacted growth for the System LSI and Foundry businesses.The Display Panel business, which manufactures OLED and LCD screens, saw increased shipments of OLED panels for premium smartphones, but profitability for LCD panels decreased due to weak seasonality, which dampened sales and ASP.For the IT & Mobile Communications Division (IM), earnings in the mobile business declined due to a hike in marketing costs under strong seasonality. Total smartphone shipments decreased due to the lineup optimization of low-end models, while shipments of flagship products, such as the Galaxy Note 8, increased from the previous quarter. In the network business, customers’ LTE investments concentrated in the first half, resulting in the weak earnings in the second half.The Consumer Electronics Division, comprising the TV and home appliances businesses, posted gains for the quarter. TV earnings increased QoQ on increased sales of premium products including ultra large-size and QLED models. For home appliances, demand for high-end washing machines and ovens in North America and Europe was responsible for stronger revenue on a YoY basis.As indicated in Samsung’s preliminary earnings announcement in early January, operating profit was affected by the appreciation of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar and other major currencies, with the impact amounting to approximately KRW 660 billion QoQ. A one-off incentive paid to employees of the semiconductor division also affected earnings.Looking ahead, the first quarter, despite being a traditionally slow season, is expected to show strong demand for memory products used in datacenters. Shipments of System LSI products are forecast to pick up, as orders for APs and image sensors for flagship devices are expected to improve.The Display Panel business in the first three months of the year is likely to face challenges such as intensified competition from LTPS LCD vendors and seasonally weak LCD demand. In spite of this, Samsung will try to improve profitability by increasing the high-end LCD portion of screens and enhancing productivity of flexible OLED panels, among other measures.In the first quarter, the company expects the mobile business to improve its earnings, led by an increase in sales of flagship products with the launch of Galaxy S9. Samsung’s TV business will be affected by weak seasonality, but is aiming to be profitable by expanding sales of premium products and pushing for the early release of new models. Meanwhile, the Digital Appliances Business will focus on achieving growth by increasing sales of premium products and strengthening marketing.In 2018, demand for NAND is likely to remain strong and market conditions are forecast to be stable. Samsung will expand 64-layer V-NAND production mainly at its Pyeongtaek plant. As for DRAM, the company expects solid demand growth due to new datacenter builds and will increase product competitiveness by expanding 10nm-class process migration. As for Foundry, Samsung will lead the technological process leadership with a risk production of 7-nano.  For the Display Panel business in 2018, the company expects OLED to become a mainstream panel in the smartphone industry and will reinforce its competencies in new applications such as foldable, automotive, and IT displays. In the case of LCD panels, it will focus on meeting the market’s needs for ultra large-size and high-resolution TVs and strengthening partnerships with strategic customers.For Mobile in 2018, the company will pursue earnings growth by increasing premium products sales and maintaining profitability of mid-range to low-end products. The Networks Business plans to expand the supply of network solutions for 5G commercialization to major markets including Korea, the U.S., and Japan.For the CE Division this year, sales of ultra large-size TVs will continue to grow as the global market gears up for major international sporting events, including the FIFA World Cup and Winter Olympics. The Digital Appliances Business is expected to improve earnings by expanding its B2B business and online sales.Total capital expenditure (capex) executed in 2017 was KRW 43.4 trillion. Investment in the display panel segment reached KRW 13.5 trillion, while the Semiconductor business was accountable for KRW 27.3 trillion. The total was up significantly YoY because of investments in the Pyeongtaek plant and efforts to address demand for the foundry business and flexible OLED panels. Samsung’s capex plan for 2018 has yet to be finalized, but we expect the total amount to decrease on a YoY basis. Looking at the mid to long term, Samsung expects the components business to see demand expand from new applications. For the set business, the company expects to enjoy increased opportunities mainly related to software, connected devices, and services based on AI/IoT platforms.In semiconductors, as demand for high-density memory products for cloud servers and for chipsets required for automotive electronics and AI is expected to increase, Samsung will boost its technology competitiveness with cutting-edge processes and solutions with next-generation packaging.The OLED panel business will strengthen its competitiveness in the premium segment with the release of foldable panels, and focus on expanding new applications in areas such as automotive electronics by capitalizing on its technology and cost competitiveness.As for the Mobile business, Samsung will continue its efforts to differentiate its smartphones by adopting   cutting-edge technologies, such as foldable OLED displays. It will also drive forward new businesses related to AI/IoT by strengthening the ecosystem based on Bixby and building on Samsung’s 5G technology.The CE Division will bolster its leadership in the TV market by applying new technologies, such as 8K and Micro LED. Samsung will also improve the connectivity and usability of home appliances by expanding the application of Bixby.The Semiconductor businesses posted KRW 10.90 trillion in operating profits on consolidated revenue of KRW 21.11 trillion for the quarter.The Memory Business achieved strong earnings amid favorable market conditions. For NAND, overall demand was strong due to strong seasonality for mobile, particularly high-density mobile products, as well as solid growth for server SSD. Samsung strengthened profitability and posted solid earnings by promptly responding to strong demand for higher-density and value-added memory products for newly launched mobile models and server SSD. For DRAM, demand for all applications increased QoQ amid peak seasonality. Server demand remained solid due to cloud expansion, new datacenters, and higher-density trends. Mobile demand also remained strong thanks to increasing set numbers and content growth, mainly from new flagship model launches. The company posted improved earnings by meeting demand for differentiated products, such as high-density server DRAM over 64GB and low-power LPDDR4X, and by flexibly managing its product mix.Looking at the first quarter outlook for NAND, server SSD demand from major cloud providers is expected to remain strong despite weak seasonality, and the high-density trend from high-end smartphones is likely to continue. Therefore, overall demand is expected to remain steady QoQ. On the supply side, supply is forecast to be limited despite industry expansion of 64-layer products. Samsung will focus on accelerating 64-layer transition and strengthening product differentiation via its V-NAND-based solutions. For 2018, stable market conditions and strong demand are anticipated and the company will focus on mass production of V-NAND while strengthening technology leadership through a ramp-up of the next generation product after 64-layer.As for the DRAM outlook in the first quarter, datacenter demand is expected to offset slow seasonality. Mobile demand is likely to decrease under the weak seasonal effect, however the decline is likely to be less than it was in the previous year thanks to demand for high density at the high-end and content growth at the low-end. Samsung will focus on continuing its flexible product mix strategy and strengthening cost competitiveness through expansion of 1xnm process migration. For 2018, continued demand for servers is expected due to new datacenter builds and increasing memory usage. Mobile demand is also expected to grow due to increasing requirements for high performance games, on-device AI, and hardware upgrades such as dual cameras. Samsung will look to enhance cost competitiveness through 10nm-class migration and expanding sales of high-density server DRAM.For the System LSI Business, earnings slowed as sales of mobile processors and image sensors decreased under weak seasonality. In the first quarter, Samsung will seek to ramp-up production of mobile processors for premium phones and expand sales of high-valued-added 3-stack Fast Readout Sensors (FRS). In 2018, demand for image sensors is expected to grow as smartphone vendors increase adoption of dual camera and 3-stack FRS. The company aims to post solid earnings by increasing mobile processor sales and expanding offerings to IoT, VR and automotive applications.For the Foundry Business, earnings decreased on weak seasonality. That said, sales in China increased as the company secured new customers. In the first quarter, earnings are expected to rise on the ramp-up of 2nd generation 10nm process products for this year’s flagship smartphones and growing demand for cryptocurrency mining chips. In 2018, Samsung will provide 8nm and 11nm processes to meet customers’ needs and start a risk production of 7-nano. In addition, we will increase its mass production capabilities at the new S3 and S4 lines for various products including mobile processors and image sensors.The Display Panel business posted KRW 11.18 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.41 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter. Despite decreased revenue from LCD panels due to lower ASPs under weak seasonality, total earnings for the display business grew QoQ, driven by increased shipments of OLED panels for flagship smartphones.In 2018, OLED is expected to become the mainstream panel in the smartphone market, specifically in the high-end segment. Samsung will make efforts to actively address customers’ demands and differentiate its technology over LTPS LCD, as well as seeking new growth engines. As for LCD in 2018, while the company foresees market uncertainties due to intensified competition, Samsung will strive to solidify its position by offering differentiated products based on its technology leadership. Moreover, Samsung will reinforce its strategic partnerships and expand the sales of value-added products. Looking to the first quarter, the OLED business is likely to be affected by declining demand due to weak seasonality and by intensifying competition with LTPS LCD in the smartphone market. To secure profitability, Samsung will focus on product line-ups for flagship smartphones and expand its customer portfolio. In addition, the company will improve the productivity of flexible OLED panel manufacturing.For LCD in the first quarter, even though a decline in LCD demand is expected under weak seasonality, the company forecasts stable utilization thanks to rising demand for large-sized and high-resolution TVs led by major sporting events in the first half. Samsung will also focus on cost reduction and yield improvement as well as expansion of value-added products such as UHD, large-sized, and Quantum Dot products to enhance its profitability in response to market conditions.The IT & Mobile Communications Division posted KRW 25.47 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 2.42 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter. While total smartphone shipments decreased compared to the last quarter, mainly in mass smartphones, sales of flagship models such as Galaxy Note 8 increased. Mobile business earnings decreased due to an increase in marketing cost amid strong seasonality.Looking ahead to 2018, demand for smartphones is expected to rise thanks to growing replacement demand for premium smartphones. In order to expand the sales of premium smartphones, Samsung will strengthen product competitiveness by differentiating core features and services, such as the camera and Bixby, and reinforce the sell-out programs and experiential stores. In addition, Samsung plans to continue optimizing its mid- to low-end lineup and enhancing productivity in order to achieve qualitative growth of the smartphone business.In the first quarter, amid forecasts for weak demand for smartphones and tablets due to low seasonality, the company expects to increase its smartphone shipments backed by the newly launched Galaxy A8 and A8+ and upcoming release of the Galaxy flagship, which will launch next month. Both sales and operating profit are expected to grow QoQ due to the rise in ASP.For the Networks Business, the second half of 2017 saw weak earnings following the completion of LTE investments from its major overseas partners in the first half. Samsung aims to strengthen its business foundation by supplying LTE base stations, mainly in North America, in the first quarter. For 2018, the company will focus on continuing to expand the supply of 5G-ready network solutions into major markets, including Korea, the U.S., and Japan.The Consumer Electronics Division, including the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses, posted KRW 12.72 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.51 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the global TV market grew by double-digits QoQ thanks to the year-end holiday season, but the market declined YoY due to lower demand in North America, China, and the Middle East. Under these circumstances, earnings slightly declined YoY due to the company scaling back on its mid-range to low-end product lineup and lower product prices from intensified competition. However, earnings improved QoQ thanks to solid sales of premium products during the year-end peak season. As for the TV market in 2018, demand for ultra-large screen and premium TVs is expected to grow led by major sporting events. As the premium market continues to expand, the company will aim to strengthen its new lineup, including ultra-large screen QLED TVs as well as 8K TVs, and bolster marketing activities. Also, Samsung will provide new experiences and add value by applying Bixby and SmartThings to its TVs. In the first quarter, TV demand is expected to decline both YoY and QoQ under weak seasonality. Nevertheless, Samsung will aim to strengthen its market leadership in the premium segment by expanding premium product sales and bringing new products to market earlier.For the Digital Appliances Business in the fourth quarter, the market saw moderate YoY gains due to continued growth in North America and economic recoveries in Europe and CIS. The business’s revenue grew YoY thanks to strong sales of premium products, including the FlexWash washing machine and the Flex Duo with Dual Door oven, in advanced markets. However, an increase in material costs and B2B investments in North America weighed on profit.Looking ahead, in 2018, Samsung will focus on new growth by strengthening its B2B business and expanding distribution channels including online ones. In the first quarter, the company will expand its premium lineupwith products such as the new Family Hub refrigerator and washing machines with QuickDrive technologyand reinforce global marketing activities.

[KH Explains] Samsung Pay safe 'for now' as Apple Pay enters Korea,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000245230?sid=104,"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 15:26:00 +0900","Experts are divided over short-term spread of Apple Pay infrastructure in Korea, but are optimistic on service's long-term prospects with young generationA customer uses Apple Pay to make a payment at a local fast food restaurant in Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)Following the initial buzz surrounding Apple Pay's launch in Korea, users have began to discuss the service's limitations.""Why bother launching a service that customers can't use? I only find it (Apple Pay) useful for paying at convenience stores,"" said a comment on Asamo, a Naver blog for Apple enthusiasts.On the blog, another commenter even derisively dubbed Apple Pay ""convenience store pay.""Korea was never expected to be an easy market for Apple Pay, partly because more than 70 percent of smartphone users here use Samsung or Android devices, with iPhone users comprising less than 30 percent.In addition, the lack of infrastructure has been cited as a significant problem, with a limited number of stores equipped with the near-field communication readers needed for the service. Out of approximately 2.9 million stores in Korea, it is estimated that only 60,000 to 70,000 have NFC readers installed.""Apple's market share is less than 30 percent, and considering the inconvenience that it has now, and also the availability of alternative payment services, it is difficult to anticipate that Apple Pay will capture more than 15 percent of the total payment market in the short term,” said Kim Yong-hee, a research professor at the Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents at Dongguk University.The lack of infrastructure is the main reason why major local credit card companies are closely observing the initial partnership between Hyundai Card and Apple Pay but have not made any moves yet.“The key factor for Apple Pay's success in Korea will be the widespread availability of the service,” said a credit card industry official on condition of anonymity.The official pointed to the lack of NFC readers and the inability to use it for public transportation. Apple has so far not agreed on terms with public transportation payment providers like Tmoney.According to the Credit Finance Association, Shinhan Card is the largest credit card issuer with 19.6 percent of the market share as of the end of last year, followed closely by Samsung Card with 17.8 percent, Hyundai Card with 16 percent, and KB Kookmin Card with 15.3 percent.However, experts here say that Samsung should not rest on its laurels.Seo Ji-yong, a business administration professor at Sangmyung University sees that the spread of Apple Pay will accelerate with the start of ""phone-to-phone"" payments last week, which he believes will mitigate the lack of infrastructure.Smartro, a subsidiary of telecom giant KT, released this app, which enables Apple Pay payments at local stores without installing an NFC terminal. It makes it possible for store owners to receive Apple Pay payments simply by downloading an app developed by Smartro on their phones.According to Samartro, there were over 140,000 downloads of the app from the Google Play Store as of the end of last month.“The burden of having to install a new NFC card reader, which costs around 200,000 won ($151.81), has been alleviated. While there are still limitations to using Apple Pay, such as its inability to be used for public transportation, it is expected that this issue will also be resolved relatively quickly,” Seo said.Kim Dae-jong, who is a business administration professor at Sejong University, also shared an optimistic view on Apple Pay's prospects in Korea.“More than half of the young generation in their teens, 20s, and 30s use iPhones, which is why Apple is expected to become increasingly more popular in the future. The high loyalty of these users is predicted to continue,” Kim said.Furthermore, Seo speculates that payment companies, such as Samsung Pay, could be considering fees for credit card firms, which he interpreted as their way of anticipating a potential loss in market share with the arrival of Apple Pay in Korea.Samsung Pay declined to comment on rumors regarding the implementation of fees similar to Apple Pay.

GFriend gets in the mood for summer with new single ‘Love Whisper’,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000190735?sid=004,"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 18:19:00 +0900","GFriend performs during a press showcase for its fifth EP “Parallel” in Seoul on Tuesday. (Yonhap)Clad in matching mint-green shirts and skirts, the six members of K-pop darling GFriend performed their summery track “Love Whisper” at a showcase Tuesday. The group had made a bold move with its previous funk-driven hit “Fingertip,” diverging from its signature innocent schoolgirl image for the first time. This time, it kept to its sleek sound in “Love Whisper,” the lead track of the group’s fifth EP “Parallel,” released Tuesday evening. For the new release, GFriend said it adopted an image of “powered-up innocence,” incorporating a dynamic and energetic performance while not straying too far from the group’s original retro sound. “Choreography for ‘Love Whisper’ was the toughest. The dance features more powerful and difficult techniques,” said band member SinB during the press showcase for the album in Seoul on Tuesday.The group added that the song’s choreography was the brainchild of a choreographer who used to work with the boy band BTS. “Love Whisper,” produced by GFriend’s longtime collaborators Iggy and Seo Young-bae, features a familiar bubblegum pop sound that recalls the K-pop of the 1990s and 2000s. The mid-tempo dance number depicts feelings of love between two people who constantly fail to reach each other. The song’s music video features the group’s six members -- Sowon, Yerin, Eunha, Yuju, SinB and Umji -- enjoying a trip to a countryside and dancing in a grassy field, a scene that has appeared in the group’s past music videos. It also shows them performing synchronized dance movements in a crystal-clear pool, just the thing to beat the relentless summer heat. Asked how the group felt about having to compete with Girls’ Generation, a seasoned group that is also set to release its new album in August, band leader Sowon said, “Girls’ Generation has always been our role model. We actually grew up looking up to the group.”“We would like to congratulate Girls’ Generation on its 10th anniversary, and it is our great honor to perform onstage during the same period as Girls’ Generation. We hope to learn more from them this summer,” she added. GFriend members also shared that they had traveled overseas to meet foreign fans, participated in concerts such as KCON in New York last month and enjoyed some free time, during which they watched movies and went shopping together, before their new release. Since debuting in 2015 under the agency Source Music, GFriend has become one of the most prominent young female musical acts here. With its innocent image, the group defies the sexy image that dominates the industry. GFriend was named one of Billboard’s must-watch new K-pop acts in 2015, after the group debuted with “Glass Bead,” a school-girl inspired tune that was reminiscent of Girls’ Generation’s 2007 breakout hit “Into the New Word.” GFriend continued its successful run with hits such as “Me Gustas Tu,” the lead track from its second EP “Flower Bud,” “Rough,” the lead track from its third EP “Snowflake,” and most recently, “Fingertip,” the lead track from its fourth EP “Awakening,” which debuted at No. 5 on Billboard’s World Album chart in March. GFriend’s latest album “Parallel” features eight tracks, including “One-Half,” “Ave Maria,” “Red Umbrella” and “Falling Asleep Again,” an R&B ballad song. “Love Whisper” peaked at No. 1 on local music charts, including Melon, Genie, Bugs and Soribada as of Wednesday morning.

[KH Explains] Apple ups ante in Samsung's home ground,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000245200?sid=104,"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 16:38:00 +0900","Despite Samsung's unrivaled dominance, Apple pins high hopes on Gen Z, half of whom are iPhone usersPeople walk past Apple Gangnam, Apple's fifth South Korean retail store, near Shinnonhyeon Station in southern Seoul. (Yonhap)US tech behemoth Apple has long maintained a low profile in South Korea, the home of its archrival Samsung Electronics, where the iPhone maker takes up a “modest” share of the market at about 20 percent.More recently, the US company seems to be upping the ante here, possibly pinning its hopes on Generation Z -- those born between 1997 and 2012 -- almost half of whom are believed to be iPhone users.According to a recent survey conducted by Gallup Korea, about 52 percent of people aged between 18 and 29 said they were using iPhones as of the end of 2022. This means that while Samsung may be outpacing Apple in overall smartphone sales, it lags behind when it comes to winning the hearts of younger consumers, who are likely to become the dominant consumer group in the near future.“Samsung itself has lacked the ‘wow factor’ to excite Gen Z,'” said Lee Eun-hee, a consumer science professor at Inha University. “It’s worth noting that Samsung is considered an ‘old brand’ among them as it doesn’t embody a different kind of value that makes its users feel proud like Apple does.”In a renewed push to expand its presence here, Apple is opening a series of new retail stores, including the latest Apple Gangnam in southern Seoul. The Gangnam store attracted much attention as it is located less than a kilometer away from Samsung’s Delight brand shop within the so-called Seocho Samsung Town. In a rare collaboration with celebrities, the company invited K-pop girl band NewJeans to promote the new store opening.Since the first Apple Store opened in Seoul’s Garosugil in 2018, the company operates a total of five stores. A sixth store is rumored to be opening near Hongdae, the pinnacle of youth culture in western Seoul, later this year.Last year, Apple logged 7.3 trillion won ($5.5 billion) in Korean sales.Possibly taking a cue from Apple’s bigger presence in its home ground, Samsung recently rebranded its retail store, called Samsung Digital Plaza, into the Samsung Store, the first revamp since the brand was launched 23 years ago.“Samsung is seeking to refurbish the store space overall to better appeal to young customers like the Apple Stores (have done), but it seems to feel limitations because of the company’s diverse product lineup from smartphones to refrigerators to large TV sets,” said an industry source close to the matter.Apple’s mobile payment service Apple Pay also recently made a highly-publicized debut here after a nearly 10-year hiatus.Many users complain about a lack of infrastructure in the initial phase. Of the nation’s some 2.9 million stores nationwide, only 70,000 stores are estimated to be equipped with near-field communication readers that work with Apple Pay.But iPhone users who had long been marginalized amid a near monopoly of Samsung Pay are responding explosively to the brand-new service. On the first day alone, more than 1 million iPhone users registered for membership to use the brand-new service, according to its official credit card partner, Hyundai Card.Industry watchers expect Apple Pay’s expansion could be directly linked to the increased sales of iPhones in the future as mobile payment is increasingly being perceived as a key feature for smartphone users here.In response, Samsung is also bolstering its preparedness as it has launched a task force, according to sources. Ahead of Apple Pay’s arrival, Samsung already teamed up with Naver and Kakao, the nation’s top two internet companies who are also key players in the burgeoning mobile payment market.Samsung is also reportedly considering applying the Samsung Pay feature to its Galaxy Watch smartwatch as Apple Watches support the Apple Pay service here.“While individuality and aesthetics are important to Gen Z, they're also very much into a brand image. If we apply these trends to smartphones, we get to understand why young people look for iPhones more,” another industry official said on condition of anonymity.In another poll conducted by local market tracker Vinu Labs, 89 percent of college students here described Apple’s brand image as “trendy,” followed by “refined” and “luxury.” Among the iPhone users surveyed, 87 percent said they would stick with the same brand, while the figure among Galaxy phone users stood at 74 percent."

[New Release] Lana Del Rey,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000037265?sid=106,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 13:57:00 +0900","           Lana Del Rey     “Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd”   Label: Interscope Records    Genre: Alternative pop    Lana Del Rey is a complicated, enigmatic pop star — since the height of her breakout album, “Born to Die,” the singer has been labeled one of the best songwriters of her generation. Her songs tell stories of dark, wistful American glamour, yearning for a dangerous time in our history with glimmers of red-hot, toxic infidelity-riddled romances and an audaciously psychedelic allure.    “Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd” is the next mega storytelling adventure for the singer-songwriter — she cuts deep into her fears, future and family instead of longing for things that aren’t hers to dream about. This time, she’s enduring the human experience in the real world — not a pretend one.    The lengthy, 16-song album explores themes of spirituality with religious undertones featuring gospel singers in “The Grants” and an interlude with Pastor Judah Smith, the leader of a controversial celebrity megachurch, Churchome. She also features Grammy award-winning uber talent Jon Batiste on “Candy Necklace” and “Jon Batiste Interlude,” producer-musician and Del Rey’s most frequent collaborator, Jack Antonoff, as his moniker Bleachers, and Father John Misty (“Let The Light In”).    Del Rey sings melancholically about her impermanence in the album’s title track, “Don’t forget me/Like the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard.” On another album single, “A&W,” co-written and produced by Antonoff, the singer gorgeously speaks to the experience of a liberated woman who wears a metaphorical scarlet letter on her chest. She examines the paradox of liberation and the condemnation sexually liberated women face as the result of their agency.    “Fingertips,” allows Del Rey to slowly ponder in a dreamy, strings-heavy ballad about her family, death and legacy: “Will I die? Or will I get to that 10-year mark?/Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?/And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?”    “Paris, Texas,” featuring SYML, feels and sounds like a lullaby, Del Rey whispering about wanderlust, scouring the world for a place to call home. “When you’re home, you’re home (Venice, California),” she sings in her breathy vocals.    “Grandfather please stand on the shoulders of my father while he’s deep-sea fishing,” is another fairytale-like ballad that dissects Del Rey’s public image and legacy. She opens the profound song with the lyrics, “I know they think that it took somebody else/To make me beautiful, beautiful/As they intended me to be/But they’re wrong.”    Other brights spots include “Margaret” featuring Bleachers — it is simply a larger-than-life love song about fated true love written for Antonoff about his relationship with actress Margaret Qualley. In a typical Antonoff and Del Rey production, the song is still and stripped back until it waits for a burst of bells and trumpets in the outro.    The wandering hour-long album closes with “Taco Truck x VB” a dark ballad that transitions to a trap-ified sample of “Venice B,” one of Del Rey’s songs from her hit album “Norman F Rockwell.” Sampling her own work shows Del Rey doesn’t have anything to prove in “...Ocean Blvd,” she’s never sounded more succinct and brazenly herself.

Asian e-commerce giants compete for bigger piece of pie in Korea,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000037227?sid=101,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 18:16:00 +0900","  Actor Don Lee, AliExpress' Korea brand ambassador [SCREEN CAPTURE]     E-commerce players in China and Singapore are competing to gain a bigger slice of sales in Korea by offering free shipping and extremely low prices on select items. A cat water bowl for 14 won (1 cent), a motion-sensing LED light for 95 won, and a laptop stand for 8 won: these are some products being sold on AliExpress, the cross-border e-commerce platform operated by China's Alibaba Group.    The items come with free shipping and can be received within a few days, though some are subject to limited-time offers or first-purchase discounts.    AliExpress has been strengthening its marketing strategy in Korea since its entry to the market in 2018.    In early March, AliExpress announced a 100 billion won investment plan in the country.    It built a Korea-specific logistics warehouse in China's Shandong Province, enabling delivery to the greater Seoul area in as little as three days thanks to its close location to the Korean Peninsula.    Last November, the Chinese shopping platform opened its first customer center in the Seoul metropolitan area. Recently, it began an exclusive TV advertising campaign with actor Don Lee as its endorsement model, in a move to counter the Chinese platforms' negative image by leveraging the familiarity of the action film star.    Qoo10, a Singapore-based site quickly growing in Southeast Asia, has been expanding its cross-border e-commerce business in Korea since establishing its Korean subsidiary last year.    After acquiring TMON, a first-generation Korean e-commerce platform, last year, Qoo10 has continued to increase its market presence by also acquiring Interpark Commerce and WeMakePrice.    TMON has already shortened cross-border delivery times by at least three days since its merger with Qoo10 by using the Singaporean platform's logistics subsidiary, Qxpress.    According to TMON, its cross-border sales surged 55.9 percent last month compared to the same period six months ago, before it was acquired by Qoo10.    ""We have greatly reduced logistics costs by using the 19 warehouses in 11 countries that Qxpress owns,"" a TMON official said. ""As delivery conditions have improved, the price competitiveness unique to cross-border shopping has become more apparent to consumers.""    E-commerce giant and the world's largest retailer, Amazon, made its way into the Korean market through a partnership with the local online marketplace, 11st, in 2021.    The cross-border shopping market in Korea has seen steady growth since around 2014, with the popularity of various sale events like Black Friday in the United States, Singles' Day in China and Boxing Day in Britain. However, the market has faced challenges due to long and costly shipping, difficulties with returns and the inconvenience of their apps.    In recent times, this trend has begun to shift as companies engaging in cross-border sales have ramped up their efforts to target the Korean market by including initiatives such as setting up Korean-language call centers and offering items at ultra-low prices.    A report by mobile data analysis company Mobile Index showed that AliExpress claimed the top spot in the domestic shopping app category in terms of downloads in March, overtaking Danggeun Market, which had held the No. 1 position for the previous 35 months.    Last year's cross-border shopping reached 96.12 million transactions at a value of $4.725 billion — an increase of 198 percent for transactions and 71.5 percent for value, compared to 2018, according to the Korea Customs Service.    The rapidly expanding domestic e-commerce industry is the driving force behind the interest in global e-commerce companies in the Korean market.    Over the years, the Korean e-commerce market has grown significantly, from 38 trillion won in 2013 to around 200 trillion won in 2022. Even though the growth rate has slowed recently, some predict that cross-border shopping will emerge as a new source of growth for the industry.    ""Alibaba is targeting Northeast Asia through AliExpress to find new growth momentum as the Chinese e-commerce market slows down,” said Lee Dong-il, a business administration professor at Sejong University.    ""However, we need to keep an eye on whether they will be able to secure as much market share as they want, given the intense competition in the Korean e-commerce market.”  "

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap)Kim, behind the JTBC hit series ""The World of the Married"" (2020) and ""Secret Affair"" (2014), expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to take the lead role in the female-centered political drama, which is rare in the local entertainment industry.    Speaking at a press conference to promote the series Tuesday, the 56-year-old, considered to be one of the finest actresses of her generation, praised the show's exploration of human nature, regardless of gender.    ""I felt vicarious satisfaction by Hang Do-hee's adroitness and cleverness,"" she said, referring to her character in the drama. ""I couldn't stop reading the script due to the tense emotional tug of war and reversals.""   Kim said she delved into Hwang's philosophy, thoughts and emotions to better portray her changing state of mind and camaraderie with the political aspirant.    ""To me, it was like Hwang Do-hee's coming-of-age story from an image maker to 'a queen maker,'"" she said. ""It will be fun to watch each character's human nature and desires, as well as secrets revealed in reversals and twists.""   Moon, best known for her acclaimed leading roles in the films ""Oasis"" (2002) and ""A Good Lawyer's Wife"" (2003), described the show as the unlikely duo's brave journey into politics.    ""It is a rare story where women jump into politics, which was interesting,"" Moon said. ""When can these many women team up for drama like this? I gladly took the offer.""   ""Queenmaker"" will be released on Netflix on Friday.   ejkim@yna.co.kr(END)"

[Weekender] Instant photos make comeback,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000245158?sid=004,"Sat, 08 Apr 2023 16:02:00 +0900","Hats, headbands and other props are stacked up on shelves inside a self-service instant photo studio. (Choi Jae-hee / The Korea Herald)In Seoul’s Yeonnam-dong, a trendy neighborhood for young hipsters, a particular trend has taken over an entire street: instant self-photo studios popping up almost next to each other.“Nine new self-photo studios have opened within just a few months in this area,” shared a person surnamed Hong who runs another such studio near Hongik University Station.It was a Tuesday afternoon and the freestanding photo studios inside stores like “Life Four Cuts” or “Haru Film” were bustling with couples and families, all eager to capture memories of the beautiful spring day with a few still shots.“I think taking instant snapshots has become a part of the younger generation’s entertainment culture these days. Most of our customers are teenagers and 20-somethings,” Hong said.Photo booth photography, which enjoyed its first boom in the late 1990s, is making a comeback in Seoul.In 2022, sales of instant photo booth franchises nationwide sharply rose by 271 percent from the previous year, while the number of new photo machines shops saw a 54 percent year-on-year increase, according to KB Kookmin’s analysis of debit card sales.A make-up zone equipped with a flat iron and hairbrush (Choi Jae-hee / The Korea Herald)Inside Hong’s 16-square-meter self-photo store with three photo booths is an open space where customers can try out a variety of props and hair styling tools like handheld dryers and curling irons.When this reporter visited, several customers -- all looking in their 20s -- were fixing their hair and applying makeup for a photo shoot. All of the photo booths were occupied.A photo vending machine operated by franchise Life Four Cuts in Gyeongui Line Forest Park's Yeonnam-dong section (Choi Jae-hee / The Korea Herald)At Hong’s place, each booth is equipped with one big machine that resembles a typical vending machine -- it has an automated camera with a touchscreen interface allowing users to adjust settings such as photo size and special effects.The photo kiosk prints photos on the spot, usually in the form of four-image strips. Each photo shoot typically costs between 4,000-5,000 won ($3.08-$3.85), and the entire process of taking and printing photos takes less than five minutes.For people in their 30s and 40s, instant photo booths are a nostalgic flashback to the late 90s and early 2000s, when photo sticker makers from Japan were all the rage in South Korea.The photos were tiny instant prints with sticky backing and came with additional features such as beauty filters, various photo frames and the ability to add text.But for the digital natives of Generation Z, the biggest appeal of instant photography is its analog element -- as old-fashioned printed images that cannot be freely edited or altered.“Instant photography makes something tangible out of a fleeting moment. It is a fresh experience for consumers like me who grew up in the digital age,” said Jeong Na-yeon, 20, who recently entered college. Real photos bring about an emotional attachment that digital images on a screen cannot replicate, she added.Lee Eun-hee, a professor of consumer science at Inha University said younger age groups have a stronger desire for self-expression, compared to their predecessors. But she added that instant photography had now also grown into a way to socialize.“Photo booths not only offer photographs but also special moments where friends and family members can chat and laugh in private settings. Since taking photos there does not take much time and money, it has become an easily accessible entertainment activity for many,” she said.Younger generations are also incorporating instant photography into special events such as weddings.Typically, couples set up one or more photo booths with instant-print cameras where guests can take photos. The guests, then, put some of their photos on the guest book, with accompanying comments, creating a special photo album for the newlyweds. The photo strips also make a souvenir for guests to take home.Wedding guests pose for a picture in front of an instant photo machine. (Courtesy of Banzzak)Lee Jae-kyung, a 29-year-old woman who tied the knot last week, said renting a photo vending machine was one of the best things she did for her wedding ceremony.“After the wedding, many friends of mine told me they enjoyed themselves during the downtime between the ceremony and reception, which might have otherwise been a little dull. The photo machine I rented had an online connection, allowing users to email the photos or directly post them on social media. I’m glad that they could have keepsakes from my wedding,” Lee said.A photo vending machine costs between 500,000 won and 800,000 won to rent, depending on the length of the rental, according to Banzzak, a local provider of photo vending machines specializing in corporate events or wedding ceremonies.Amid the recent surge in the popularity of instant photos, the demand for photo printing has also been on the rise, which has led to the launch of self-service printing kiosks in convenience stores.In January last year, CU, Korea's top convenience store chain, set up self-service printing kiosks called “printing boxes” in 30 of its branches across the country. The machines allow customers to print photos or documents from their PCs or smartphones by themselves.According to BGF Retail, the firm behind the CU chain, the average monthly usage of printing boxes per store has increased nearly fourfold from 100 to about 400 cases over the past year. Teens and people in their 20s comprised nearly 70 percent of the total users."

Local department stores showcase high-end art to attract attention,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000036454?sid=103,"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 10:51:00 +0900","   Artist Kim Jae-yong’s glazed ceramic donuts are installed at Shinsegae Department Store’s Gangnam branch. [MOON SO-YOUNG]     On the third floor of Shinsegae Department Store’s Gangnam branch, amid the slew of high-end boutiques, artist Lee Ufan’s 1992 masterpiece “With Winds” casually hangs as if it were on display at an art museum. The painting is not for sale, according to the department store; but other artworks on the same floor such as a flower print by American artist Alex Katz and a painting by Lee Sang-won are up for grabs.      Nationally-hailed artist Lee Jung-seob’s (1916-1956) first solo exhibition in 1955 was at the Midopa Department Store (the now Lotte Young Plaza in Jung District, central Seoul), so the relationship between department stores and art isn’t new per se. But unlike the past when art was shown only in certain sections of department stores, since 2020, art now coexists with other consumable goods in a single space. Today, major department stores such as Shinsegae, Lotte and Hyundai are partaking in this trend, incorporating art into their customers’ shopping experience.      “More people took interest in art during the [Covid-19] pandemic as they began decorating their homes, and as investments in art saw a boom among the MZ Generation [a Korean term collectively referring to Generation Z and Millenials], department stores began to display artworks so that their consumers could easily see and buy them,” said one department store employee.      Some denounce the trend by saying that this type of art display lacks a coherent theme and debases the act of presenting and buying art to that of just regular, everyday products.    Lotte Department Store’s art content department director Kim Young-ae fully recognizes these concerns but believed the phenomenon was also “offering the public greater access to more art.”    “We are also trying to improve our art displays by holding more exhibits with themes,” she added.      “[The purpose of art displays at department stores] is more about company branding than trying to make a profit out of selling many art pieces. People’s impressions [of a space] are strongly affected by visual images so there is the intention of trying to imprint a sophisticated image of the brand to our consumers.”      In regards to concerns that department stores are replacing art galleries and taking away their share of the pie, department store employees say they are hosting exhibitions in collaboration with existing galleries.      For instance, 10 percent of sales for artist Kim Jae-yong’s glazed ceramic donuts that were installed in Shinsegae Department Store’s Gangnam branch last month went to Hakgojae Gallery, according to a gallery employee. Hakgojae Gallery is a major local gallery that artist Kim is signed under.    Smaller gallery ThisWeekendRoom’s director Kim Na-hyung agreed that art in department stores is “certainly an opportunity for contemporary art to move closer to the public.    “However, many who visit department stores are often only interested in pieces with bold colors or ones that have immediate eye-catching images, thus, the artists who can benefit from that promotional effect are limited. Also, people ultimately come to department stores to consume goods, which means that many may have a lower level of understanding about some of the art pieces. In order for these exhibitions to become more than just a one-time event and do more than trigger their [customers] curiosities, the department stores should have an education system, similar to ones at galleries for novice collectors.”      2022 Lotte Art Fair Busan [LOTTE DEPARTMENT STORE]     Department stores are enthusiastically jumping into the art market, often in hand with existing art fairs. Hyundai Department Store’s Busan branch opened “2023 BAMA Preview with Art Hyundai” in February. It served as a preview for the Busan Annual Market of Art” which concluded earlier this month.      Lotte Department Store partnered with Busan’s local art fair Art Busan and plans to host “Lotte Art Fair Busan 2023” at Signiel Busan, in May.     "
"[Kim Seong-kon] If you are proud of your country, act accordingly",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000244619?sid=104,"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 05:28:00 +0900","According to newspaper reports, today’s young people in Korea feel lucky and proud to be born in South Korea. There is a plethora of reasons. For example, recently, the United Nations dubbed South Korea as a developed country, which suits the country in every sense.Indeed, South Korea has now become a fully developed, advanced country both economically and technologically. South Korea’s economy is the 4th largest in Asia and 13th in the world. Its military power, too, ranks 6th out of 145 countries. Considering the relatively small size of the country, South Korea’s accomplishments are quite remarkable.Furthermore, K-pop has enchanted the world for the past decade and so have Korean films and TV dramas. As a result, many foreign young people eagerly want to visit South Korea, and young Korean men and women are welcomed overseas, all thanks to the popularity of Hallyu. Surely, all of these phenomena are an encouraging sign of South Korea’s becoming an attractive, admirable country.In the eyes of the older generation, especially, the change has been quite spectacular. My contemporaries and I have witnessed South Korea make a quantum leap from an unknown, destitute country to a well-known, affluent one. In the past, when we traveled overseas where few foreigners knew where Korea was located, we had virtually nothing to be proud of our country. These days, therefore, we are emotionally touched to see young Koreans who are proud of their country.Today, South Korea is no longer a poor, weak country, but an affluent, strong country. As such, Koreans should think and act the part. Indeed, when and if you became a citizen of an economically stabilized and culturally influential country, you should think and behave accordingly.First, you should be decent and elegant. An English maxim says, “Well fed, well bred.” Indeed, in any society when they become economically well off, people become courteous and observe propriety. If so, you, too, should be graceful and gallant.For example, you should be gentle and benign, not petulant and fastidious when dealing with other countries, especially friendly nations. You should be subtle and delicate, and beware of losing your dignity and integrity. Sometimes, you must restrain your emotions and become rational. Other times, you should exhibit common courtesy and politeness, even when you are upset. That is what we call diplomacy.At the same time, you do not need to take a servile attitude with an obsequious smile toward a bully country simply because it is bigger or stronger than you are. Instead, you should be stately and dignified. Only then can you earn respect from it.Second, you should be generous toward other people and other countries. Showing magnanimity and leniency does not disgrace the country, but in fact boosts the image of the country in the eyes of the international community. When your government acts accordingly, therefore, you must applaud such a policy, instead of harshly criticizing it. In fact, generosity and tolerance are outstanding characteristics of an advanced country. In order to be a truly advanced country, you should overcome narrow-mindedness and intolerance.Third, you should be grateful for everything that has made today’s South Korea. For example, you should be thankful to the older generation that has successfully turned the poor, weak country into an affluent, strong one through toil and tears. Without their hard work and sacrifice, you could not have enjoyed today’s prosperity. Instead of despising them for their stubbornness, therefore, you should pay respect to older people. You can never imagine what kinds of ordeals they have gone through in order to make today’s South Korea what it has become.You should be appreciative to the US for its invaluable contribution to the making of contemporary South Korea by liberating your country from the Japanese occupation, rescuing you during the Korean War, and helping you rebuild your nation after the war with an astronomical amount of financial assistance.Likewise, you, too, are now obliged to help developing countries. You are also supposed to return the favor you once received from the US by joining America’s new plans and help out. Some radicals instigate anti-American sentiment, calling for the pullout of the US troops from the Korean Peninsula. However, that is exactly what North Korea wants. Think about the consequences. What do you think would happen to South Korea when there were no US troops in there?Another thing North Korea wants is everlasting enmity between South Korea and Japan. The US press recently reported that in retaliation to the summit meeting between South Korea and Japan, North Korea furiously launched another missile. South Koreans do not need to support North Korea’s interference with the South Korea-Japan relationship. Besides, maintaining good terms with Japan and the US is imperative for South Korea’s national security. China and Russia will always be allies of North Korea.Now we are living in an affluent and advanced country. Accordingly, we should have good manners, decorum and common sense.Kim Seong-konKim Seong-kon is a professor emeritus of English at Seoul National University and a visiting scholar at Dartmouth College.

Feminism leaks through the cracks of K-pop girl group industry,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000036042?sid=106,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 15:46:00 +0900","   Members of girl group Twice pose with no makeup on in the group's teaser for its latest dance track ""Set Me Free."" [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Representing the K-pop scene of 10 years ago, Girls’ Generation called their bare face something that “needs to be kept to themselves” in their song, “I Got a Boy” (2013). Now, in the teaser video for girl group Twice's recently released EP “Set Me Free,” the members are shown taking off their makeup layer by layer.    A seemingly free and rebellious culture it may be, but K-pop tries its best to avoid involvement in some of the most pressing issues around the world, especially regarding gender. In an industry with a strong taboo on the mere mention of feminism, Twice’s “Set Me Free” comes as an ode to the silent wave of awareness on women’s rights that has been building up in the oppression that is Korean “pop” culture.    “The title song ‘Set Me Free’ carries the message, ‘Let’s break free from everything that holds us down and love freely,’” Twice leader Jihyo explained in a press release. “We hope that it lets people see another side of Twice.”    Although the makeup removal scene was not a major part of the full music video, the teaser was enough to win praise from viewers who lauded the video for “setting themselves free from the standards society set for women” in a YouTube comment with over 1,500 likes, among many others.       Member Mina of girl group Twice in the group's teaser video for its latest dance track ""Set Me Free"" (2022) [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Member Dahyun of girl group Twice in the group's teaser video for its latest dance track ""Set Me Free"" (2022) [SCREEN CAPTURE]     The fact that it was Twice, of all the girl groups, who took their makeup off adds more meaning to the theme. Although all K-pop girl groups inevitably fall back on their beauty and femininity to appeal to audiences, Twice in particular has been marketing itself as the pretty teenage girls longing for men’s approval.    “I’m the prettiest of all, everyone else has a hard time because of me,” read the lyrics to its 2015 debut track “Ooh-Ahh,” while its 2016 dance track “Cheer Up” sang “A girl’s heart shouldn’t be easy to get, that way you’ll like me more.” In “Likey” (2017), the lyrics read “looking good is so tiring, but I can never give it up.”    The idea of looking pretty and beautifying oneself is still prevalent in Korean society, but K-pop acts have been pushed to the limit when it comes to upholding high standards on looks — hence the name “idols” as they are referred to in the industry.    Young teenage girls were forced to be skinny to the point of damaging their health, repeatedly bleach their hair to pull off the craziest colors, have no hair on their body, and always have perfect skin despite the layers of thick makeup they had to keep on in case a camera was ever present — all while doing so with a smile for the viewers.    The strict beauty rules were perhaps at their peak in the early 2010s, when female confidence was considered to come from nice dresses and trendy makeup.    In 2015, singer Park Bo-ram released a song entirely dedicated to the idea of “getting prettier,” “being complimented” and “being loved” in her slow-tempo dance track “Beautiful,” while girl group AOA released “Miniskirt” (2014) that complains of how “If I wear a miniskirt and walk down the street, everybody looks at me but you.”       Music video for girl group Girls' Generation's ""I Got a Boy"" (2013), which has lyrics that refer to a girl's bare face as something that “needs to be kept to themselves” [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Singer Park Bo-ram's 2015 dance track ""Beautiful,"" which is dedicated to the idea of “getting prettier,” “being complimented” and “being loved” [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Girl group AOA's 2014 dance track ""Miniskirt"" has lyrics that say, “If I wear a miniskirt and walk down the street, everybody looks at me but you.” [SCREEN CAPTURE]     During such times, singer Sunmi appearing on stage bare foot for her track “Full Moon” (2014) and girl group Kara wearing track-suit bottoms and sneakers for “Mister” (2009) were considered “shocking.” An unorthodox female trio who called themselves the Piggy Dolls debuted in 2011 pushing for the idea of body positivity and confidence, but failed to gain much attention.    “When you call someone a goddess or fairy, you’re objectifying the person, and, in the larger sense, restricting their actions,” culture critic Choi Ji-seon wrote for an interview after writing her book “Is Goddess a Compliment?” (2021) to criticize the way female K-pop acts are consumed.    “The idols are forced to act as the non-human, a sexually innocent and have-no-needs being, within the bounds of a goddess or fairy. They need to take the time and effort to make it work, but as soon as the day comes when that image no longer works, they are discarded.”    The idea of true femininity independent of the male gaze has been springing up in the K-pop realm with the so-called fourth-generation girl groups, though notably without the feminist nametag.       Girl group WJSN [SCREEN CAPTURE]       Girl group ITZY [JYP ENTERTAINMENT]     Girl group WJSN’s “Butterfly (2022) reads, “I may not be fancy, but I’m free” and ITZY’s debut number “Dalla Dalla” (2019) is all about “Don't need Prince Charming, ain't got time for love” and “Don't bring me down 'cause I dare to be different.”    Leader Soyeon of girl group (G)I-DLE explained that her latest dance track “Nxde” (2022) was spelled with an “x” instead of a “u” in the spelling of the word nude, because a woman’s nudity “isn’t meant for you,” according to the interviews she held with the local press.    This is not to say that K-pop has embraced the “corset-free” movement that fired up in Korea in the late 2010s. The movement constitutes a part of a larger social crusade in which women strip away the conventional forms of beauty expected by society, including abandoning makeup, not conforming to ideal body types and cutting their hair short.    In fact, “You’ve gotten prettier” is still accepted as a normal compliment in Korean society. Contrary to the Western world where the mere mention of someone else’s appearance or face can be considered rude, Korean people often do not hesitate to ask whether another person has gained weight or had something done to their faces.       Girl group (G)I-DLE [CUBE ENTERTAINMENT]     Feminism is expected to remain one of the biggest taboos for Korean celebrities for a long time. Failure to stay away results in immediate backlash.    In 2018, Irene of girl group Red Velvet was bombarded with nasty comments when she said she recently read the feminist book “Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982.”    In March 2018, a fan asked Irene during a meet and greet what book she had recently read. The singer answered, and days later the internet was filled with angry posts calling her a feminist and showing pictures of Irene’s photo cards which had been cut up or burned.    A similar case took place in 2019 with singer HA:TFELT, formerly known as Yeeun of Wonder Girls. After she publicly revealed herself as a feminist, a practically forbidden move for a K-pop figure, she was bombarded with hateful comments on her Instagram, such as “Only old and ugly female celebrities turn feminist.”    “Progress is definitely being made, even though it’s only up to a certain point where it doesn’t offend people,” said critic Park Hee-a, who explained that girl groups singing about alcohol and drinking — as in the case of Girls’ Generation’s “Party” (2015) and Twice’s “Alcohol-Free” (2021) — is also a part of that change.    “It’s especially difficult for older generation girl groups to change because things were different from back when they debuted,” Park said.    “Still, girl groups have become more open about who they are and showing that to the public. Change may be taking place slowly, but it’s there. The fact that Twice was the one pushing for this theme is also meaningful, considering the change they’ve gone through since their debut. There is definite progress.”  "
[Song Young-gil] Lessons from France’s energy policies,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000244112?sid=104,"Mon, 06 Mar 2023 05:31:00 +0900","Increasing the share of nuclear energy to replace renewable energy is considered a move against carbon neutrality. Whenever the current South Korean government insists on the legitimacy of its pro-nuclear energy policy, France, a powerhouse in nuclear energy, is cited as a successful case.However, a closer look at France’s nuclear power policy within the framework of its energy mix shows that Korea and France are quite different in many aspects. The two nations' energy policies share some similar elements but there are differences in their approaches.First of all, Korea and France have nuclear power policies that differ widely in terms of managing radioactive waste disposal facilities and using nuclear power as a means to empower renewable energy. France has the highest share of nuclear energy in the world, accounting for 69 percent of its energy mix. France's dependence on nuclear energy is at least double that of Korea. However, if we take this number out of context, we are likely to misunderstand the importance of renewable energy in France.The Macron administration is pursuing the energy transition in two directions. One is by expanding the share of renewable energy, and the other is by reducing nuclear's share in electricity generation. As of 2021, the share of renewable energy stood at 23.6 percent after a steep hike over a few years. Meanwhile, coal-fired power generation, the main culprit of carbon emissions, has practically been phased out in France. The country has driven out coal-fired electricity generation through a complementary mix of nuclear and renewable energies. However, in Korea, coal-fired power generation accounts for 34 percent of its total electricity.France’s attempts to reduce nuclear energy's share in its electricity generation and expand renewable energy's portion instead have not been so smooth. The original goal was to lower the share of nuclear power from 70 percent to 50 percent by 2025, but the target year was put back 10 years to 2035 under the Macron government. The road to carbon neutrality by 2050 seems to have become more difficult. Nevertheless, French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to raise renewable energy's share above 40 percent by 2030, no matter how difficult that may be.France’s nuclear power policy -- including the shutting down of old nuclear power plants -- provides some insights for Korea. A case in point is the Fessenheim nuclear plant, which was permanently closed in 2020. In general, the lifetime of a nuclear plant is about 40 years but can be extended up to 60 years through proper reinforcement works. The Fessenheim had operated for 42 years until it was closed in 2020. The nuclear power industry claimed that it could operate for more than 20 years through 2041. The Macron government’s solution was to establish a mechanism to compensate for the closure of a nuclear power plant under the assumption of 60 years of operation. Specifically, in order to cover the estimated loss of the Fessenheim company, the Macron government estimated electricity sales proceeds from the plant at 400 million euros ($424 million) under the premise that it would keep operating until 2041.Korea has not taken such measures in closing nuclear power plants. The Korean government seems to attribute Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO)’s deficit to the shutting down of nuclear power plants, without taking such fundamental measures. Obviously, KEPCO’s loss is closely related to the rise in raw material prices, so measures to compensate for its loss should not be ignored. In this respect, the Fessenheim case shows a way to incorporate a profit-loss structure into a policy to close nuclear power plants.Another lesson from France’s energy policy is that nuclear power plants should be backed by the sustainable management of nuclear waste. Critics liken Korea’s nuclear power policy having no waste management plan to “an apartment without a bathroom.” As for nuclear waste disposal facilities in Korea, it took more than 30 years to construct a medium- and low-level radioactive waste disposal facility. Following twists and turns, such as the strong opposition of local residents of the island of Gureop-do in Incheon and Buan County, North Jeolla Province, the facility was finally built in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. What's worse, the plan to construct a high-level radioactive disposal facility by 2050 has a long way to go. The Korean government has not even secured an underground research facility, which is a prerequisite for constructing such a waste disposal facility. It is only a matter of time before the current waste disposal capacity reaches saturation.As a nuclear power plant was included in the European Union’s Green Taxonomy, it is deemed an element of carbon neutrality. There is no reason to deny the role of safe nuclear power plants backed by proper waste disposal facilities. The first step is for the National Assembly to set up an institutional framework for safe nuclear power plants. Related bills have already been submitted to the National Assembly.To dispel Korea’s image as a country economically advanced but backward in terms of its climate change policy, all stakeholders must get involved in the energy transition to decarbonization. The government must recognize nuclear power and renewable energy as complementary energy sources that go hand in hand. Carbon-emitting companies required to produce their goods using renewable energy need to draw up action plans regarding RE100, the global renewable energy initiative of businesses through investments in renewable energies and the recycling of resources.Song Young-gilSong Young-gil is a visiting professor at the ESCP Business School in France and an executive adviser to the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK).

""Teddy Bear,"" set to drop at 6 p.m., is the group's fourth single and latest release since the third single ""We Need Love"" in July.   It has two tracks -- the title song ""Teddy Bear"" and the Korean-language version of ""Poppy,"" the main track off its Japanese debut album that was released in November. The Korean song came out on Feb. 3 ahead of the new album's release.   ""If we took on a sentimental and mature image with the previous title, 'We Need Love,' we're back with a positive and optimistic vibe this time,"" member Isa said during a media showcase for the new album at a music hall in eastern Seoul.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap)Team leader Sumin said, ""I heard many people gained strength after watching us performing on stage. I hope this song will also serve as a stepping stone for them to energetically start the new year.""   ""Teddy Bear"" was written by Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon, who showed fantastic synergy with the K-pop act in their past songs.   The band members singled out ""Every one of us lives life for the first time"" when asked what was their favorite lyric of the title track.   ""Everybody can thus make mistakes and grow and learn through them. I'd like listeners to pay attention to the lyric like 'There is no right answer',"" Sumin said.   The six-piece group debuted in November 2020 under High Up Entertainment, a minor K-pop agency, with the song ""So Bad"" from its first single album ""Star to a Young Culture."" It has since grown to be one of the leading fourth-generation K-pop girl groups, along with NewJeans, Ive, Le Sserafim, aespa and Nmixx, releasing hits such as ""ASAP,"" ""Stereotype"" and ""RUN2U.""   When questioned if the group felt any pressure about the quality of the new release, Sieun said, ""I would be lying if I said I was under no pressure, but I think one cannot escape from such pressure if he or she is a singer.""   She found the pressure dwindling when she tried to focus on the message that she wants to deliver through the album and how to perform the songs on stage.   Closing the media showcase, she once again expressed hope that many people would be cheered up and comforted by listening to the group's music because that was the reason for producing the upcoming album.   ""I hope they can smile and feel refreshed after looking at us in their tiring daily routines. I also hope we can be the byword of comfort and hope.""   sshim@yna.co.kr(END)"
[Lee Kyong-hee] Princesses of North Korea’s Kim dynasty,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000244032?sid=104,"Thu, 02 Mar 2023 05:33:00 +0900","The massive military parade in Pyongyang on Feb. 8 lived up to North Korea’s reputation as a “theater state.” Monster missiles rolled through the brightly illuminated Kim Il Sung Square; impeccable columns of marching soldiers shouted loyalty to their Supreme Leader and his sacred bloodline; and a sea of spectators cheered and wept with joy.But the most memorable image was a child, Kim Ju-ae, standing at center stage alongside her father, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. The spectacular celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Korean People’s Army turned into a skillfully choreographed, nocturnal prop for her presence.Equally surreal was the scene of her first public appearance at a missile launch site last November. What is the world’s most secretive country trying to say? Kim Ju-ae is thought to be only 9 or 10 years old. Is she a new propaganda tool to remind everyone that her mythicized family lineage is intact and positioned? Furthermore, has she been chosen to be the fourth-generation leader in the Kim dynasty? If so, why reveal it now?These questions naturally prompt speculation about the fate of her aunt, Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of Kim Jong-un. She has been known as the country’s de facto second-in-command and regarded as the heir apparent. Yet, she did not appear at the military parade with her brother and niece, while Ri Sol-ju, the first lady, walked behind them.Shortly after the celebration, North Korean authorities reportedly began to force girls and women named Ju-ae to change their names. Incredulous as it may sound, North Korea forbids its people from sharing the same first names with their leaders. Ju-ae has now become banned in the country ruled by a virtual monarchy, as were the names of Korea’s kings and princes centuries ago.In another move to solidify the “respected” daughter’s place in its cult of personality, the North has released a series of postage stamps carrying photos of Kim Jong-un and his beloved daughter posing before Hwasong-17, the North’s most advanced ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) capable of reaching the US mainland.Contrary to widespread conjectures that the sudden rise of Kim’s young daughter should mean the downfall of his once-powerful sister, there also are cautious voices warning against hasty conclusions. Ju-ae is Kim’s second child. The eldest is known to be a boy, who has never been publicly seen. North Korea is still a deeply patriarchal society. A son is typically expected to take over the family business. Many would say that the sister has never been next in line. The son may be officially named the successor in due time.Whichever is the case, Yo-jong should know better than anyone that her position as the most relied confidante to her brother could be precarious if she coveted more power. She has witnessed bloody power struggles in her family. In 2017, her half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated at an airport in Kuala Lumpur after years of living abroad in exile. In 2013, Jang Song-thaek, her uncle by marriage and the second most powerful person in the North’s leadership, was executed on charges of treason and corruption.Yo-jong developed an aptitude for the family business; she was interested in politics and diplomacy, or so thought her father, the Dear Leader Kim Jong-il. In 2007, she started her career as a junior cadre of the Workers’ Party of Korea, mostly assisting her father and brother behind the scenes.It is said that during those early years in her career, Yo-jong was groomed for a leadership role by her aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, the only daughter of Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder, and the only sister of Kim Jong-il, the second leader. Kyong-hui performed the same supporting role for her own brother and probably knew the challenges Yo-jong would face engaging in politics.Kim Kyong-hui filled a range of positions, most notably as director of the Light Industry Department of the Workers’ Party of Korea. An army four-star general, she was also a member of the party’s exclusive Political Bureau. Yo-jong also took a seat later. They are the only women ever admitted to the powerful body.Kim Kyong-hui and her husband, Jang Song-thaek, mentored Kim Jong-un in the initial years after he succeeded his father, who died in December 2011. But two years later, Jang was accused of being a counterrevolutionary, stripped of all his posts and executed by a firing squad within a week. By that time Jang and his wife are said to have been estranged. Kim Kyong-hui disappeared from public view a few months before her husband was killed. She was rumored to have had a fatal stroke, heart attack, committed suicide, or have been ordered to be poisoned. But six years later, she reappeared, though politically inactive.In 2018, Kim Yo-jong became the first, and to date the only, member of the Kim family to cross the border to South Korea since the Korean War, leading the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. She drew an outpouring of attention from the South Korean public, reigniting hopes of peace on the peninsula. Regrettably, she soon turned to hostile rhetoric against Seoul and Washington, as the US-North Korea summit for denuclearization in Hanoi, Vietnam fell apart. She reportedly led the demolition of the inter-Korean liaison office, built in the border city of Kaesong with South Korean taxpayer money.Many people still remember her role in the inter-Korean and US-North Korea summits held during the brief period of detente. Today, as military tensions escalate in the region, anxiety grows over possible armed clashes triggered by accident or bad decisions by leaders. Instability due to rivalry in leadership, whether in Seoul or Pyongyang, will likely exacerbate crisis.There certainly are roles women in power can fill in delicate steps toward peace. It would be wise to take advantage of diplomatic experience and skills accumulated at historic events to explore new opportunities for dialogue and reconciliation.Lee Kyong-heeLee Kyong-hee is a former editor-in-chief of The Korea Herald. -- Ed."

[Kim Seong-kon] South Korea in the Year of the Tiger,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000233582?sid=004,"Wed, 05 Jan 2022 05:32:00 +0900"," According to the Chinese zodiac, the year 2022 is the Year of the Tiger. Although the younger generation in Korea is perhaps no longer interested in the zodiac, it still counts for the older generation. The zodiac says that those who are born in the Year of the Tiger are bold, courageous, and confident. At the same time, however, they tend to be impetuous, overindulgent, and unpredictable.The shape of the Korean Peninsula has invited some interesting debates. Some people argue that the shape of the Peninsula resembles a rabbit. Others maintain that it looks like a shrimp. Yet there are also those who contend that the Peninsula resembles a tiger. The rabbit is the image of a weak, docile, and peace-loving animal, and the shrimp may have the connotation of being a victim in the midst of a fight between whales. On the contrary, the tiger is the image of strength and ferocity. Those who lived through Korea’s turbulent history over the last several decades support the rabbit or shrimp theory, whereas nationalists prefer the tiger image. Lee O Young, former Minister of Culture, presents an interesting theory. He contends that the Korean Peninsula resembles a trophy that strong nations want to possess. Since competitors constantly arise to challenge each other to win the trophy, Korea has always been vulnerable to the rise of a new power in the international community. In the Year of the Tiger, South Korea should be “bold, courageous and confident,” when dealing with neighboring countries when and if they act like bullies or are hostile and threatening. At the same time, Korea should not be “impetuous, overindulgent or unpredictable,” in her relationship with friendly nations. If we stand up to bullying nations, they would not dare to offend us anymore. When we are consistent and predictable to friendly nations, they will remain our faithful allies. If we act otherwise, we will be hopelessly bullied by hostile countries and lose respect and trust from friendly nations.Some time ago, a group of Korean political science professors gathered at a roundtable meeting to discuss the future of Korea in the ever-intensifying conflicts between China and the US. They unanimously insisted that South Korea should not choose one of the two. Disappointingly, however, they did not come up with any specific tactic of managing this dilemma. Perhaps, not choosing a side is what “politics” is all about. Nevertheless, we expected some concrete guidelines from them in dealing with the compelling issues that will directly affect the future of Korea. In 2022, the final hours for Korea to choose between the two options will come. We can no longer defer our decision and continue an opportunistic posture between the two. In the year 2022, we sincerely hope that our politicians choose wisely, so our country will continue to prosper and thrive. If our representatives make a wrong decision by any chance, our country would suffer the consequences and the future of our country would be grim. Besides, South Korea would lose respect in the international community. That would be equally fatal for the future of Korea. The problem is that it is extremely difficult to find a solution to the dilemma we are now facing. Perhaps one way to get out of the quagmire is that we build a nation that is strong and has precious things the two conflicting countries urgently and desperately need. Among others, semiconductors and electric batteries come to mind. Then, the two rival countries would treat us with greater respect. Currently, Samsung and Taiwan’s TSMC manufacture 70 percent of semiconductors of the world. Since Samsung’s main strength lies in semiconductor memory, which occupies a relatively small portion of the market, it should expand its manufacturing capacity to other semiconductors. In 2022, the Korean people will have to make another choice. In March’s presidential election, Koreans will choose the person who will run the country for the next five years. It will be a choice not only between conservatism and progressivism, but also between capitalism and socialism, or liberal democracy and a people’s democracy. Our choice on that fateful Election Day will decide the destiny of Korea. Indeed, Korea will be at the crossroads in 2022. If we choose the wrong road, we will be lost and doomed. If we choose the right road, however, our future will be bright and prosperous. Therefore, it is imperative for us to choose the right leader who can steer our country in the right direction in a perfect storm. In the year 2022, we wish South Korea to become the tiger that poet William Blake described in his celebrated poem, “The Tyger.” It begins with, “Tyger Tyger, burning bright,/ In the forests of the night;/ What immortal hand or eye,/ Could frame thy fearful symmetry?” We hope South Korea will emerge as a healthy, strong tiger roaring loudly and proudly on the peak of a mountain, not as a wounded, depressed tiger hiding in the jungle. Kim Seong-konKim Seong-kon is a professor emeritus of English at Seoul National University and a visiting scholar at Dartmouth College.

Fine dining specialists discuss Korea's role in global haute cuisine,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035368?sid=103,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 05:00:00 +0900","  Dishes served at Korean restaurants located in New York [MICHELIN GUIDE, JOONGANG ILBO]     In recent months, there have been two major developments in the world of fine dining.    In early January, Noma, often ranked as the world’s No. 1 restaurant, located in Copenhagen, announced it will close permanently at the end of 2024. The reason? René Redzepi, the chef, said they could no longer afford the intensely long hours and workforce required to serve the dishes the restaurant has been serving to global acclaim.    Earlier, in perhaps the most significant development since Korean food began making international inroads, the Michelin Guide awarded its coveted stars to 10 Korean restaurants in New York City, often cited as the global culinary capital. Of the 10, three received two stars each, and the rest one star. Does this portend a global expansion and recognition of Korean food?    To talk about the latest in the world of haute cuisine and the future of Korean food in the world, two specialists in the field got together to discuss the matter — Samuel Koo and Jean-Pierre Gabriel.    Gabriel is a Belgian food journalist and photographer who has written more than a dozen widely acclaimed books on food, ranging from Thai food to Venetian cuisine and truffles. Among them is “L’Air du Temps” (2007), written together with the Korean-born Belgian chef Sang Hoon Degeimbre. He has won Gourmand’s Best Book award.    Koo has had a long international career in journalism and UN organizations. He also held senior positions in and out of the government in Korea including stints as Korea’s ambassador for cultural cooperation and chairman of the Presidential Council on Nation Branding. He ran “Seoul Gourmet,” an international haute cuisine festival, in Seoul in the 2010s with Gabriel as his consultant.    The following are edited excerpts of the interviews conducted via email.      Samuel Koo         Q. The recent announcement of Noma’s planned closing sparked a storm in the culinary world and beyond. The New York Times printed it on their front page, along with many others. Why? Is haute cuisine or fine dining now a concern for so many people? Or has Noma done something extraordinary to attract global attention?      A. Gabriel: Noma’s announcement, in my view, confirms René Redzepi’s talent as a great communicator. He is a first-class PR man, besides of course being a wonderful chef. There are other chefs, equally good or even better, but they do not necessarily get to the No. 1 position on the San Pellegrino chart of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants. In short, there are chefs like the legendary Ferran Adrià of the now-defunct El Bulli or the Roca brothers of El Cellar de Can Roca Joan, both from Spain, who achieved top stardom without the media's help.       Koo: Indeed. Networking and media play seem increasingly important for chefs these days intent on climbing the rankings ladder. In this sense, I am not sure how authoritative the 50 best rankings are as the barometer of the quality of food served. I tend to give more credence to other awards, most notably the Michelin guide. Regardless, earning a spot on the 50 Best tends to assure not only global fame but also business success. So, in that sense, being on that list is much more powerful than earning Michelin stars.           It appears the meaning of haute cuisine has changed over the years and is still changing. Is that so?      Koo: I always thought, and still think, haute cuisine is having a wonderful meal at an elegant restaurant. In this sense, just about all Michelin-starred restaurants — there are exceptions of course — belong in this category. In Asia, traditionally, a well-prepared full-course meal, bansang in Korea and kaiseki in Japan, served in ornate restaurants, was considered fine dining. But that concept is now undergoing a change globally.       Gabriel: In the West, fine dining stems from the art of entertaining the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie. What mattered then were not only the ingredients and the preparation but also the service in an elegant setting. It is no coincidence that the celebrated chefs of that era often made a career in luxury hotels. Then came a revolution of sorts. Led by Auguste Escoffier, known as the king of the chefs then, a movement began to modernize the kitchen. “Cooking, without it ceasing to be an art, will become scientific and will have to submit its formulas, which are too often empirical, to a method of precision.” This was the start of what later became molecular cuisine.       Koo: Ferran Adrià was among the early pioneers of molecular gastronomy. But with it also came the exotic or often bizarre use of ingredients. When I dined at El Bulli in December 2009, I was served a set menu of 53 items which included fresh hare brains swimming in a somewhat sour liquid. Even counting 3 aperitifs, 53 was a bit too much for one meal.       Gabriel: When it comes to the high temples of gastronomy, the key word today is no longer haute cuisine or fine dining but “experience”! The experience a diner undergoes at the table and around it. Not only the rabbit brains you mentioned but also live ants and fake snail eggs. Heston Blumenthal, the celebrated British chef [of The Fat Duck], invented dishes appealing to multiple senses. A dish of fish and seaweed is served in a beautiful seashell as the sound of sea waves and the birds play in the background. In Paul Pairet’s Shanghai restaurant, the guests are immersed in a virtual universe [with images and sounds], which is supposed to enhance the taste of the dishes! For this exotic reason, top restaurants invest so much money in architectural decor and special effects.    In the three Michelin star restaurant Frantzen in Stockholm, food is served on four floors, with each diner moving from one floor to another during the meal. At Alchemist in Copenhagen, chef Rasmus Munk suggests, for example, sucking a human silicone tongue to taste the delicate herbs placed on it. The show (because it is indeed a staging) is also political: if the chicken leg arrives in a metal cage, it is to protest against the enclosed birds; the pork whose sauce is injected by a syringe is a manifesto against antibiotics.      Jean-Pierre Gabriel     One controversial element of the world’s top restaurants is the widespread practice of their using unpaid interns in the kitchen. Shouldn’t this be rectified?      Koo: It is not a simple issue. On one hand, you have legions of aspiring young chefs eager to learn the craft from globally recognized masters. More selfishly, they want to use that experience as part of their resumé in their effort to secure a position at a good restaurant. This is not necessarily unique to gastronomy. A similar situation exists in such areas as music, arts, and other fields. But of course, if one is asked to work for a long period, for more than 6 months, for instance, I do believe the intern should be paid.       Gabriel: Anyone who has the ambition to make a name for oneself in a profession or an art dreams of the best apprenticeship one can find. If the race for Michelin stars is part of your quest, it is obvious that you will ring the doorbell of starred restaurants. Important as this may be, I also do not think it is acceptable to use an intern for longer than 6 months without pay or use the intern to do one single repetitive task for the entire period. Like what happened to Namrata Hegde who, during her 3 months at Noma, tirelessly repeated the same gestures: preparing 120 copies of a trompe l’oeil beetle: a glossy, three-dimensional creature made from fruit skin. The same practice existed at Noma until October 2022, when René Redzepi was forced to pay the many trainees for their repetitive work in the kitchen.           Is there a country or cuisine whose success Korea can learn from as it strives to further popularize Korean food overseas? Japan, for instance? In working toward this goal, Korea has presented Korean cuisine as a health food. What other virtues of Korean food can we publicize?      Gabriel: The Korean culinary culture has many values and special characteristics — fermentations of all kinds, vegetables, the vegan temple cuisine of Zen temples, not to mention the magic of the Korean table, bansang, laid out in front of you. However, the younger generation of Korean star chefs seems to place more emphasis on contemporary style. But to defend an identity, you must first be aware and proud of your own traditional culinary richness. For example, from its first publication in Japan, Michelin awarded 3 stars to sushi and kaiseki restaurants. The Japanese chefs have not veered from their traditions. In my eyes, the best traditional Korean restaurants offering an extraordinary bansang deserve 2 or 3 Michelin stars and are the way to go for young chefs.       Koo: You touch on an important point. I agree with you on the path the Japanese chefs have taken in great part. But what really has taken off internationally for Japanese cuisine is sushi, and not anything else like kaiseki, and sushi does not require any modernization. All but one of the Japanese restaurants decorated with Michelin stars in New York last year are sushi places. The lone exception was a single tempura restaurant. For Korean chefs, it’s a mixed bag. Let us look at the Michelin-starred Korean restaurants in New York. More than half of them are taking a modern approach or a super modern approach. In extreme cases, the Korean-ness is lost in my view. However, there are others who have simply refined the traditional style, earning recognition for traditional noodles, barbecue and even bar food.    One excellent case is Oiji Mi Restaurant, which basically presents refined yet traditional Korean cuisine in a course menu. In short, I believe the jury is still out on whether the emerging Korean chefs will adhere to the traditional or revised modern style, but either way, it is likely to succeed in spreading Korean food.      Dishes served at Atomix, a Korean restaurant in New York, United States [ATOMIX]        Has Korea’s effort to globalize Korean food been effective?      Koo: No doubt it has done a lot of good. Korea's organized and voluntary efforts that launched two decades ago are bearing fruit as we see in New York City, for example. Michelin also recognized a large number of Korean restaurants in Seoul. In New York City, Korean cuisine garnered more Michelin stars than any other ethnic cuisine except for Japanese. Korean and Asiana airlines also have contributed in an important way to popularizing Bibimbap. Not surprisingly, all of these restaurants in NY are packed day in and day out, and they usually require reservations at least four weeks in advance.       Gabriel: First of all, it must be recognized that many actions have already been undertaken at different levels in Korea, in particular since the creation in 2009 of the Korean Food Foundation, called today the Korean Food Promotion Institution. I am thinking, among other things, of the multiple actions taken by the Ministry of Agriculture. Personally, I would like these actions to be more coordinated and for a real multi-year national plan to be put at the service of the globalization of Korean cuisine. I see the benefit of taking a two-pronged approach toward a double target — at the level of gastronomy and great chefs, and at the level of making available essential Korean ingredients, including high-end products, to the world food market.           Which country do you think has been most successful in popularizing and globalizing its cuisine from which Korea can learn?      Gabriel: First and foremost, Spain, which in my view is the best example of a concerted action involving the best chefs, regional governments, the high-end food industry — wines, Iberian ham, olive oil, et cetera — and food congresses. As we know well, this teamwork has placed Spain at the very center of European gastronomy ahead of France, the traditional powerhouse. Leading this gastronomic crusade in Spain was, of course, Ferran Adrià who almost single-handedly turned the tide in Spain’s favor.       Koo: However, the global forerunners in this regard are Chinese and Italian food. Pasta is everywhere. Of course, the Chinese and Italian cuisines were helped and driven by the large overseas populations of both countries. But while Italian food has also made major inroads into the haute cuisine world, Chinese in large part remained just neighborhood fast food and takeout restaurants. In this global development, Italian cuisine was helped by Italy’s star chefs.       Gabriel: Yes, Italy’s success was first based on the immense Italian diaspora, which was also proud of its roots. Italian cuisine was first developed through this network. It then became more sophisticated, relying on cooks and products. In certain ways, Italy’s Ferran Adrià was and is still Massimo Bottura (Osteria Francescana in Modena), another veteran No. 1 winner of the 50 Best. Italy offers more of course — the great artistic patrimony, cinema and arts, beautiful cars and fashion. You notice that Italy has also succeeded in marketing such high-end items like white truffles from Alba and aged balsamic vinegar from Modena.      A dish served at Mari, a Korean restaurant in New York [MICHELIN GUIDE]        Can the Italian example be applied to Korea?      Koo: Not to the full extent because the size of the overseas Korean community is rather limited. However, the popularity of Korean food is fanned by the immensely popular K-pop, K-cinema, and the global penetration of Korean electronic goods and, of course, cars. The Korean success in New York, however, has yet to be replicated elsewhere in the world, but like K-pop in the early days, a major success in one important cosmopolitan city like New York is likely to give the Korean effort an important added boost.           Can well-organized food festivals contribute to globalizing Korean food?      Gabriel: Indeed. Most countries wanting to develop the image of their cuisine have done so through special events like food festivals. Among them are Lo Mejor de la Gastronomía (San Sebastian, Spain) and Madrid Fusion, Identità Golose (Milan, Italy), the Flemish Primitives (Bruges, Belgium), Chefs Alps (Zurich, Switzerland), Mistura (Lima, Peru), World Food (Istanbul, Turkey), Tokyo Taste, Omnivore (Paris, France), MAD (Copenhagen, Denmark) and of course Seoul Gourmet.       Koo: I believe the Seoul Gourmet festival we ran together for many years in the 2010s also made an effective contribution toward introducing Korean food and its ingredients to the top chefs of the world including Redzepi, the Roca brothers, and Massimo Bottura, all No. 1 spot winners of the World’s 50 Best rankings in recent years. All told, we brought to Korea 10 chefs with 3 Michelin stars and many others from Latin America, the United States and Europe. The lineup included Corey Lee before the opening of Benu (San Francisco), the only Korean 3-star chef in the world outside of Korea today. I felt the most important part of Seoul Gourmet was its immensely popular masterclass by these world-renowned chefs. Hundreds of young aspiring chefs packed into the classrooms. Many of them have gone on to become important chefs in Korea and abroad.       Gabriel: The impact was and remains much greater. When a guest chef, for example, is looking for specific ingredients or, more simply, wants to visit a market to learn about Korean ingredients, we refer them to “young” Korean chefs. Through encounters like this, friendship is forged. I remember a meal with Massimo Bottura and another with Francesco Illy, in the very first Mingles. Both left the table concluding that it was one of their best meals. In the same way, Kang Min Goo was able to spend time in the cuisines of Pascal Barbot or Emmanuel Renaut in France.       Koo: Another episode comes to mind. When we hosted this wonderful lunch at Jingwansa Temple. Jordi Roca, one of the most talented chefs in the world, exclaimed “This is the best meal of my life!"" And he was serious.  If we are going to be successful, it appears essential that we train foreign chefs. Is Korean cuisine special and attractive enough for foreign chefs to learn? Could they become successful by being Korean food chefs?        Gabriel: Why not create a Korean International Culinary Academy for Foreigners?    I don't think you can expect many foreign chefs to become experts in Korean cuisine. But it's a safe bet that Korean dishes will find important niches, such as with other food like pizza, dim sums, spring rolls and ramen. In this respect, one might be surprised that many poke bowl places have recently emerged. Bibimbap can easily overtake them. But whatever route Korea may take, one link is still missing: the availability of Korean ingredients. It is indeed much easier to find a Chinese or Thai pomelo than a Korean turnip. The basic pantry should include gochujang and its variations, ganjang of different ages, tashima, gim, roasted gim, salt, dried anchovies, maesil and yuja.      Koo: I do believe there is a growing market for foreign chefs who cook Korean cuisine. Last year, I went to two Korean restaurants in Brussels, and both were run by Belgian chefs, with excellent food. They told me they learned Korean cooking from Korean chefs. Both places were packed. The availability of Korean ingredients remains a serious issue, and rectifying this ought to be a high priority item for the state-supported Korean food organizations if Korea were to be successful in globalizing its food.

[Robert J. Fouser] Learning from the history of IT in Korea,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000243508?sid=104,"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 05:31:00 +0900","On my visit to Korea last fall, I was lucky to have enough time for many long walks in Korean cities. On a walk through central Seoul, I passed by Sewoon Arcade, the famous commercial-residential complex across from Jongmyo. In the 2010s, the city of Seoul pushed plans to preserve the complex, but redevelopment of surrounding areas is going forward. Since it was built in 1966, the complex dwarfed its neighbors, but the tall buildings going up nearby make it look strangely small now.As I looked at the shrunken facade of the arcade, my thoughts drifted back to the late 1980s when it was the main electronics market in Seoul. The Yongsan Electronics Market opened in 1987 and quickly became the largest electronics market in Seoul. Both markets offered buyers access to the latest gadgets at competitive prices, which helped fuel the digital revolution that swept South Korea in the 1990s.By the 2000s, South Korea became known as an “internet superpower” thanks to its high internet diffusion and fast speeds. Since then, the nation has maintained this reputation as a leader in early adoption of the latest technologies, from smartphones to the metaverse. The nation’s technological prowess has bolstered the “cool Korea” image that emerged with Hallyu and later K-pop.For all its importance, the history of IT in Korea often goes unmentioned in discussions of the nation’s economic and social development. How did South Korea turn itself into an “internet superpower”? The question is particularly interesting in comparison with other advanced countries, such as Japan, that have fallen behind South Korea.In looking at the history since the 1990s, two main reasons emerge: policy and mindset. In the early 1990s, PCs began to spread rapidly, and domestic internet providers emerged. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 that caused the nation to turn to IMF loans forced a restructuring of the economy. To spur economic growth and create jobs, the government began investing heavily in venture IT companies that focused on new technologies.One result was the high-speed cable modem. By late 1998, cable modems began to spread rapidly, particularly in apartment complexes that could wire many households quickly and economically. South Korea soon jumped to the top in internet access speeds, which spurred the growth of web use faster than elsewhere in the world.At the same time, the government supported companies that produced IT hardware, much of which was aimed at growing export markets. Samsung and LG, meanwhile, jumped into the booming mobile phone market and became leading producers by the early 2000s. After slow but steady growth, Samsung sales took off in the late 2000s, turning it into a global player.A mindset, particularly that of a nation, is difficult to define, but the willingness to embrace change in South Korea has propelled the development of IT. The push toward industrialization beginning in the early 1960s brought rapid change to Korean society. A poor rural nation under dictatorship became an urban industrialized democracy 30 years later. In this process of compressed development, change was constant, and those who embraced it quickly did better than those who did not.When PCs, the internet, and the web began to spread in the late 1990s, people jumped on the bandwagon for fear of falling behind and losing out. In the 2000s, this psychology played itself out in rapid adoption of mobile phones, smartphones and social media.The same ""fear of missing out"" mindset influences decision-makers in government and business to be forward-looking compared to their peers in other advanced countries. They know that things are always changing, so instead of trying to keep change at bay, they embrace it quickly in the hope of using it advantageously. This explains the early push for digitization of government services and sensitivity toward the latest global IT trends in the business world.The big question for South Korea is whether these two pillars of IT success will weather generational change. Compared to the boom years, the pace of change has begun to slow, which may make people less willing to embrace it. The young generation, which grew up in prosperity, avoids risk and prizes stability, though in social trends, FOMO remains strong.As the young generation moves into decision-making positions, policy and business could become risk averse. This would sap Korea of the forward-looking dynamism that energized the IT and other booms, which risks sending it into quiet decline.Robert J. FouserRobert J.

LG H\&H to display portable tattoo printer at MWC tech fair,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035228?sid=105,"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:15:00 +0900","  LG Household & Health(LG H&H)'s temprorary tattoo printer Imprintu will be displayed at the MWC 2023 in Barcelona [LG H&H]     With a week left before this year’s MWC kicks off, LG Household & Health (LG H&H) said Monday that it will display a portable tattoo printer at the tech fair.    It is the first time for a local cosmetics company to attend the MWC event.      MWC, or Mobile World Congress, is the world’s largest connectivity event held in Barcelona, Spain. This year’s MWC will run for four days from Feb. 27, Monday, under the theme of “Velocity: Unleashing tomorrow’s technology — Today.”    About 2,000 companies from 160 countries will attend the tech show, including SK Telecom and KT from Korea.    LG H&H became the latest and unexpected addition to this year’s booth list.      The cosmetics company plans to showcase its temporary tattoo printer named Imprintu — a portmanteau of impromptu and print — at the MWC 2023.    The temporary tattoos printed on the skin with the Imprintu device last for about a day, according to LG H&H. The printer will allow users to create a temporary tattoo of any image they want and print it using a vegan ink cartridge developed by the company.      Tattoo designs created by LG’s Exaone multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) system will be uploaded on the Imprintu app, said LG H&H.    Imprintu will be available in the North American and Korean markets in the second quarter this year, and will later be released in other regions.      SK Telecom's quantum crypto chip, a combination of a quantum random number generator and a crypto chip, co-developed with IDQ and KCS [SK TELECOM]      KT and SK Telecom, Korea’s two largest telecom companies, are also attending this year’s MWC. Each company’s CEO and SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won will be present as well, along with Minister of Science and ICT Lee Jong-ho.    It is the first time for Chey to attend the MWC.    LG U+, however, decided to withdraw its plan to set up a booth, following the recent customer data leakage incident and network disruptions caused by cyberattacks.    At the MWC 2023, SK Telecom plans to set up a 1,000-square-meter booth to showcase its urban air mobility (UAM) and AI-related technologies, including its AI chip Sapeon.    The company will also display its next-generation quantum crypto chip, a semiconductor for security purposes that can be used in internet-of-things devices, for the first time at the MWC. Co-developed with SK Square's subsidiary IDQ and KCS, a local IT company, the quantum crypto chip is a combination of a quantum random number generator and a crypto chip.      KT's booth at the MWC 2023 event, which will be held in Barcelona from Feb. 27 to Mar. 2 [KT]      KT will present AI chip technologies of local start-ups Rebellions and Moreh, as well as AI delivery robots, with a focus on digital transformation. KT invested 30 billion won in Rebellions and has 3.94 percent of Moreh.    Five sub-themes for the MWC 2023 are: 5G acceleration, reality+, OpenNet, fintech and digital everything.    Network usage fees will be one of the hot topics as well, as the European Commission is mulling imposing an internet traffic tax on big tech companies.     "
Kim Jong-un Visits Military Living Quarters with His Daughter on the 75t...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/032/0003203799?sid=104,"Wed, 08 Feb 2023 17:38:00 +0900","Kim Jong-un, leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), attended a banquet celebrating the 75thanniversary of the foundation of the Korean People’s Army (Feb. 8), along with his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, on February 7, according to the coverage by the Korean Central News Agency on February 8. Yonhap NewsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un, accompanied by his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, visited the lodging quarters of military commanders and attended a banquet commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) on the eve of the anniversary.On February 8, the Korean Central News Agency reported, “Chairman Kim Jong-un made a visit to the living quarters of the KPA commanders on February 7 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army, which would be engraved in gold letters in the history of a powerful and self-reliant (juche) Korea.”Chairman Kim was accompanied by his daughter, Kim Ju-ae. The North Korean state media stated, “When Kim Jong-un arrived at the living quarters along with his honorable child, the commanders in the Ministry of Defence and the corps and division commanders of the KPA greeted them with the warmest respect and affection.”This was the third time that a picture of Kim Ju-ae attending a formal event was released since she appeared at the launch site of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Hwaseong-17, last November and took a picture with experts who contributed to the missile launch. On January 1, the Korean Central TV showed Kim Ju-ae observing the inside of a missile base along with her father.In a banquet after the visit to the military living quarters, Chairman Kim praised, “I find myself bowing my head whenever I see our armed forces struggling like an undying spirit with the power of determination, overcoming all mental and physical limitations in every aspect in the protection of our national sovereignty, the defense of our people, and the grand creation.” First lady Ri Sol-ju also attended the banquet along with her daughter.Kim Jong-un mentioned how he sought the KPA first whenever the country faced a challenging situation, how he had entrusted the military with the task of a bigger struggle, and how the North Korean military, just like himself, knew no hesitation when it came to the call of the party. He said, “As the supreme commander of such an excellent military, I have the greatest honor, and I find myself immersed in infinite pleasure when I resolve to share the fate of our military.”The leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) continued and said, “Our armed forces have fulfilled the call of the times and history as the strongest military in the world,” and argued, “For eternal peace, for true prosperity and development, and for all descendants in this land, we have endured much pain and suffering, and at last have achieved great and absolute power.”The Korean Central News Agency reported on February 8 that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (front row right) attended a banquet celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army along with his daughter, Kim Ju-ae (center), and first lady Ri Sol-ju (left) on February 7. Yonhap NewsChairman Kim claimed that the image of the DPRK “growing tougher in the turbulence and growing stronger amidst trials” was reflected in the image of its armed forces and said, “There are hundreds of countries on Earth and more than a few armies that boast of a long history and tradition, but the Korean People’s Army is the only military that shares its fate with the party, the nation and the people throughout its entire operation, contributes to that authority and greatness, and guarantees that high honor and bright future.”The North Korean leader made an effort to strengthen internal solidarity by praising his armed forces on the eve of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army. Kim, accompanied by his daughter, stressed continuous loyalty crying power for the future generation. North Korea is expected to hold a massive military parade in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of its armed forces in Pyongyang on Wednesday.		"
[Weekender] The collaboration 'X' factor: When consumption meets cultura...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000232791?sid=104,"Sat, 04 Dec 2021 16:02:00 +0900","Looking back on what we have consumed over the year could be one way to wrap up the year 2021, while preparing to make better choices in the new year. Whether an impulsive purchase or a considered decision, consumption patterns show what we desire and what cultural codes and trends are leading the society today. The pandemic challenges the once taken-for-granted in-person connections and communications. But this year also saw active communication between the market and businesses, leading to several successful collaborations.“Collaboration is multiplication,” said John C. Maxwell, an author and public speaker. This can also be applied to how smart collaborations can double the attention of consumers, especially those looking for something not just new, but fun. In Korea, they are often referred to as “funsumers.” Funsumers mainly are of the digitally savvy “MZ generation,” born between 1980 and 2000. The population census puts the MZ generation at an estimated 3.43 million, accounting for some 35.5 percent of Seoul’s population.Although difficult to generalize, this generation is said to be more open to expressing their preferences, opinions, likes and dislikes, when compared to baby boomers -- those born in the mid-1940s to 1960s. Thus, they tend to actively share their experiences both on and offline, making the products or services they enjoy go viral. Collaboration across different fields are forecast to continue as a leading trend in Korea in 2022, brought on by new consumption patterns. 　Product collaboration- Daehan Flour Mill X 4XRA first-time traveler to Korea might easily mistake the polar bear logo for a popular domestic snack brand, but it isn’t.The Gompyo logo represents Daehan Flour Mill, whose products range from wheat flour to pancake mixes.The Gompyo collaboration began purely by chance in 2017, when online shopping mall 4XR began selling T-shirts with Gompyo’s bear printed in retro designs. Instead of suing the shopping mall for copyright infringement, Gompyo decided to join hands with the brand to make more collaboration merchandise. The collaboration items expanded to baseball caps, puffer jackets and backpacks, which were sold with consecutive reorders.Learning from the success, Gompyo began to launch other collaboration series, partnering with LG Household & Health Care to make Gompyo toothpaste and detergents. Teaming up with 7Brau, it released Gompyo canned beer and popcorn.Park Jae-jeong, brand marketer of Gompyo, said the aim was to maintain the existing brand image, but “give witty tweaks to the brand” with varied products to offer a fun experience to consumers. - New Balance X Ofr. Paris In March, popular sports brand New Balance paired up with Ofr. Paris, a bookstore in Paris founded by Marie and Alexandre Thumerelle. The launch excited many avid travelers in Korea who are also interested in street casual attire. Over the past two decades, Ofr. Paris has become a must-visit store in the French capital for the MZ generation. The store also expanded into a gallery, studio and publisher. Under the theme ”My Little Paris,“ Alexandre’s own font is inscribed on the designed t-shirts, slippers and eco bags, along with New Balance’s quality-proven garment materials and logos. ”It‘s not just about loving one brand or the other. I liked the image of the two logos mixed and designed together, forming an idea that travel, arts and books, can all connect to fashion,“ Lee Ju-yi, a fashion and style editor in Seoul, told The Korea Herald. Platform collaboration- From web comics and novels to shows and gamesPlatforms evolve as technology develops, but an appealing narrative is appealing regardless of its form.Web novels and web cartoon series that have proved successful are making inroads into other platforms with their original storylines, to draw audiences on a global scale. A recent example is Netflix Korea’s fantasy horror series, “Hellbound,” directed by Yeon Sang-ho of “Train to Busan (2016).” The series started out as a web comic created in 2019, also by director Yeon, who worked with illustrator Choi Gyu-seok. Choi is the author of another megahit web cartoon series “Awl (2013),” which has been made into television drama series “Songgot: The Piercer (2015),” after the original web cartoon attracted millions of fans.“I did not know that ‘Hellbound’ was a web cartoon, until I saw posts of the director’s past works,” Ha Dong-hee, an office worker in her early 30s, told The Korea Herald. “While digging into Yeon’s original works, I was mesmerized by the sharp depictions shown in illustrations, so that led me to reading Choi‘s web cartoon.” Another hit collaboration on a different platform is “Dalbit Jogaksa,” a fantasy novel written from 2007 to 2020, by author Nam Hui-seong. Comprising 58 volumes, the novel was published both in print and online over the years. While the novel was being published, game developer XL Games, saw the potential of turning the story into a mobile game. The novel-turned game, titled The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, was launched in 2019 to immediate success, ranking first in sales on Apple’s App Store and second on Google Play. The popularity of the game was led by fans and enthusiasts of the original novel. Likewise, fandom culture expands as viewers come to engage through different platforms. The cases also prove that as long as the narrative is attractive to the loyal fans, they return to the piece no matter what the medium. Space collaborationIn a crowded metropolis like Seoul, people are constantly running against time, juggling multiple tasks at once. Traffic congestion only further exacerbates the problem during peak rush hours.Online spaces and “metaverse” are rising as the next big thing to solve this lingering issue, but there are times when one still needs to be physically present. In September, SparkPlus, an office space rental agency based in Seoul, rented and opened co-working spaces at four subway stations around Seoul -- Gongdeok, Madeul, Yeongdeungpo-gu Office, and Wangsimni stations -- on top of the existing 25.Some 210 people registered in 2016 when SparkPlus first opened their shared office space in Seoul. The number has grown significantly over the past five years, reaching 14,980 members this year with an estimated annual sales of 45 billion won ($38.2 million). “We thought of expanding our spaces to subway stations, since it saves a considerable amount of time for remote workers and startups. They can easily drop by to spend a few minutes to several hours before they move to their next meeting, having a guaranteed work space inside the subway station,” a SparkPlus employee told The Korea Herald. The employee also added that a clean and well-organized space fully equipped with printers, coffee machines and the latest magazines, is essential to accommodate the needs of office workers.Another example of collaboration among spaces is the convenience store CU’s banking kiosks within stores. In October, CU opened the first domestic Private Label Convenience Store at CU’s Macheon Park branch, in collaboration with Hana Bank. The kiosks can handle up to 50 major banking tasks, providing customers with easy access. After a month of operations, the number of visitors increased by 20 percent, proving the success of the unique combination of convenience stores and banks, according to CU’s operator BGF Retail. BGF Retail is looking to expand their PLCS locations with businesses that need offline channels to increase brand awareness, but do not wish to open a brick-and-mortar store, to secure win-win opportunities for brands and consumers.By Kim Hae-yeon (hykim@heraldcorp.com)"
Lithuanian students take their love for K-culture to the classroom,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000035069?sid=100,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 16:48:00 +0900","  Liuthanian students pose with their Korean language teacher Lee Jun-eon in a beginner-level Korean language program of the King Sejong Institute at Mykolas Romeris University on Feb. 7. [ESTHER CHUNG]    VILNIUS - The sun had set an hour earlier in Vilnius, but the day was far from over for a group of students huddled in a brightly lit classroom at Mykolas Romeris University in Lithuania on Feb. 7.      They sat with a united purpose: to learn the language of their favorite actors and stars in Korea.    “How do you differentiate between simsimhaeyo and jiruhaeyo?” asked one student in the class.    In response, Lee Jun-eon, who is teaching the beginner-level class of some 10 students ranging from middle and high school to university students, used a recent Korean movie, “Decision to Leave” (2022), for context. From time to time, Lee also referred to lyrics of hit songs from boy band BTS to explain certain Korean expressions.      The students nodded their heads at such cultural references.      “Everything started when I watched the K-drama ‘True Beauty,’” said Victorja Tamulyte, a 17-year-old who travels an hour from home twice a week to attend the Korean language class run at the university.      Finishing the tear-jerking series only piqued her interest in finding a more permanent connection to Korea.    “I began hoping to at least be able to watch K-dramas without subtitles, but a bigger dream is to work in Korea,” she said.       A page of notes taken by a student during the Korean language class at Mykolas Romeris University on Feb. 7. [ESTHER CHUNG]     Tamulyte is one of around 200 students enrolled at the King Sejong Institute (KSI) at the university, taking the beginner to intermediate Korean language programs provided by the institute in cooperation with the Mykolas Romeris University and the Dongseo University in Busan.      The program launched in 2014 with just 30 students and one teacher, but quickly grew over the years as more students showed interest in learning the native language of their favorite pop artists and actors. Today it is one of the largest KSI programs in the region.      “Many enroll who have already been exposed to Korean culture and music,” said Lora Tamosiuniene, the director of the program since its infancy. “Registration for the Korean classes have been very active, the seats fill up within hours.”    The Korean language was among the seven most popular languages chosen by over 40 million users of Duolingo, a language-learning app, in 2022, and was considered to be one of the fastest growing languages in Brazil, France, Germany, India, and Mexico in recent years.      Some graduates of KSI have realized their dreams, like Violetta Lukoit.      A 22-year-old graduate of the university, Lukoit studied Korean for three years at KSI in Vilnius, during which time she was also able to experience life in Busan as an exchange student at Dongseo University.      She now works for Gwangcheon Nori, a Korean seaweed manufacturer based in Vilnius supplying over 20 countries in Europe.      “The Korea that I experienced was actually even better than the image I had about Korea from watching its dramas,” said Lukoit. “So to be able to work at a Korean company and use the language daily, it is more than I could have imagined when I first started learning.”      Violetta Lukoit during her semester as an exchange student in Busan. [VIOLETA LUKOIT]    The constant switch between Lithuanian and Korean can be difficult, as the two languages share almost nothing in common, but there may be more people like Lukoit in coming generations who can bridge the seemingly distant communities, said Lee, who has been teaching the Korean language across several continents including the Southeast Asia and Europe.      “For the generation who grew up in an environment where they can access Korean culture at any time through the Internet, the language has become an attractive language that is easy to access, and no longer a rare and mysterious language in the East,” Lee said.      “There is a visible increase in the number of students who have been exposed to the Korean language from their teenage years,” she added. “Even before I came to teach here a few years ago, Lithuanian students have been loving and studying the Korean language even when the Korean Embassy has yet to have its physical presence here.”   "
"[Column] Without change, ancestral rites will disappear",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000034311?sid=110,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 19:48:00 +0900","          Lee Ji-young   The author is an editorial writer of the JoongAng Ilbo.      Another holiday season has passed. It was the first Lunar New Year in three years without a gathering restriction. Compared to previous holidays tainted with domestic discord and violence triggered by stress and conditions, this year’s holiday passed more smoothly.  Choi Young-gap, chairman of the Sungkyunkwan Confucian Association Headquarters — a gathering of Confucian scholars across the country — is nervous every time he celebrates the Lunar New Year and Chusok holidays. He feels that if the culture does not change, it will disappear.  Since assuming his position last June, Choi came up with two hit ideas as the country celebrated the two holidays. Last year, he held a press conference before the Chuseok holiday and declared, “Jeon [pan-fried food] doesn’t need to be included in the ancestral rites.” And before this Lunar New Year, he issued instructions on the proper way to bow with the keywords, “bow with your hands on the belly.” These are the fruits of the Sungkyunkwan Ritual Establishment Committee, which he chairs.  Choi, the 24th generation descendant of Choi Deok-ji (1384-1456), who served as a senior official handling court protocols in the early Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), is a Confucian scholar. While serving as head of the Sungkyunkwan Education Center, Choi created the Ritual Establishment Committee and began to systematically organize Confucian rituals such as Goyu, the rite of conveying thoughts to the family graves or Jongmyo Shrine, and Seokjeon, the service to the Confucian saints.  I wondered why he took the lead in simplifying the holiday rituals. I met him at the Yurim (Confucian) Hall in Myeongryun-dong, Seoul, on the afternoon of Jan. 21, when people started to return to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year holiday.  “I thought we were too late. We did not see reality objectively. We were complacent and insensitive. I thought it would be simply a complaint from some women doing hard work for their husbands’ ancestral rites. But in the generation under 60, men also refused to take the initiative in their ancestral rites. I was surprised to see that they just don’t want to go against their parents while they are alive,” Choi said.  His unconventional recommendation to stop the efforts to make jeon for the holiday was a strategic move to break the “old” image of Confucianism. He thought the ancestral rites would be the most effective target for a revamp.  He was right.  He found the basis in Confucian scriptures. The Book of Rites says, “Major courtesies should be simple.” Kim Jang-saeng, master of the study of rites in the Joseon period, also wrote, “It is not a courtesy to use oily food for the ancestral rites.” Yi Hwang and Yun Jeung, both great Confucian scholars in the Joseon Dynasty, also left a teaching not to use fried cakes and jeon for ancestral rites. The table for the ancestors is already simply prepared in the head family of Yi Hwang.  Korea’s Confucian experts already knew this all along. Then why did they neglect the suffering of housewives who had to make jeon at every ancestral rite of their husband? Choi admitted, “We didn’t change the etiquette that was passed down for a long time. Even if it is late, I would continue to study and announce the corrections in our Confucian rituals.”  I asked him if there was any opposition or controversy within Confucian circles over the simplification. “Confucianism is treated as the main culprit of gender and generational conflicts, but the core of Confucianism is the courtesy to respect and care for others. Confucian scholars in Korea are also active in simplifying holiday traditions. In fact, a survey on ancestral rites conducted in July last year showed that 41.8 percent of the Confucian scholars cited ‘simplification’ as the most needed improvement, higher than 40.7 percent of the general public,” he said.  For the ancestral rites, he says a “two-track” approach is needed. By proposing a simplified model, the general public should have less burdens while the original form of the tradition should be preserved at a national level in a form of intangible cultural asset and world cultural heritage. “While Confucianism came from China, only Korea continues the ancestral rites. There are currently less than 10 families among the head families around the country that hold ancestral rites in the traditional way.”  I asked him the reason for keeping the ritual culture. He said, “In Confucianism, ancestral rituals are not an ominous event but a celebration. The original intention was for families to get together and have a good time. The power of uniting the family and clan, the smallest community, is displayed at the time of crisis and becomes the basis of the community spirit.”  His claims were reasonable throughout. I also asked about the order of visiting families for holidays. The issue of spending most of the time with the husband’s family during the holiday was addressed in the million-selling book “Kim Ji-young, Born 1982” and drama “No, Thank You.”  “It’s not Sungkyunkwan’s role to advise where to go first. Couples should consider that as in-laws are also their parents, they are free to go where they please after discussing the matter. Last Chuseok, I visited my wife’s family in Seoul first, and for the Lunar New Year, we went to my family in Muan first.”  "

(Im Se-jun/The Korea Herald)""Tale of Department Head Kim at a Conglomerate Who Owns a House in Seoul"" by first-time writer Song Hee-koo is a three-volume series about characters who work at a large conglomerate in Seoul. The last of the series hit local bookshelves in November 2021.The title may raise questions about the ""ideal"" image of a middle-class worker in South Korea. It would be someone who owns a house -- preferably in Seoul -- and works at a big company like Samsung, LG or SK and ultimately becomes a department head who sits on the executive board.That’s one of them, at least.A survey by HN Investment and Securities revealed what people think constitutes a “middle-class” household. For many, the definition of middle class is a family of four earning an average 6.86 million won ($5,500) a month and spending 4.27 million won of that, with total assets of 940 million won and property worth 840 million won.“Tale of Department Head Kim at a Conglomerate Who Owns a House in Seoul” came out in 2021 as the prices of seemingly everything -- be it stocks, property or cryptocurrencies -- were going up. Suddenly everyone was talking about real estate. This phenomenon lasted throughout 2020 and 2021, until the property and stock markets began tumbling early last year.The first volume of the trilogy follows Kim, who is overconfident and pays a lot of attention to what other people think about him. He feels jealous when he sees his younger colleagues' cars are imports. On the other hand, he cares little for his subordinates when it comes to work, disregarding reports from the youngest employee. Ultimately, his mindset catches up to him and he is let go for lacking team spirit.The book shows how individuals deal with the situations they face at work, offering realistic characters in even more realistic settings.The story follows Kim as he pours his retirement package into a newly built property soon after being laid off. Lured in by the possibility of renting it out to Starbucks, he is ecstatic about the idea of having a secure monthly income from such a highly sought-after renter.However, as is the case for many South Koreans searching for post-retirement security, he is cheated out of his plan. His failure echoes the struggles of retired Koreans who resort to opening a convenience store or fried chicken franchise. The keen understanding of how financially bleak life after retirement can become is the underlying theme in this story.“Department ead Kim and other people in similar positions, you could say, are successful beyond the middle class. I wanted to pull back the curtain and show the problems these seemingly well-off people like Kim have,"" the author told The Korea Herald in a recent interview.Members of the older generation valued the pursuit of society's standards and constantly compared themselves with others. But now, they are left suffering with a sense of inferiority, Song said. “What they face in the end often is quite tragic,” he added.The country’s younger generations are not free of constant comparison with others either, which is well described in the second book that follows an assistant manager who pursues a life of immediate satisfaction under the popular catchphrase “YOLO,” shorthand for “You only live once.”""Now people are swamped with information and seeing what other people have, and they try to mimic it,"" he noted.While comparing ourselves to others is part of human nature, whether or not we decide to become cynical or negative is an individual choice, he said.""Some just give up (on the idea of saving) amid soaring property prices, turning instead toward more affordable overconsumption to ease their feelings of deprivation. In addition, some lose patience and seek a quick return on more short-term investments,"" the 38-year-old author said.""Tale of Department Head Kim at a Conglomerate Who Owns a House in Seoul"" (Seo Sam Dok)It comes as no surprise that many readers confess the characters in the book sound very familiar. The author works at a major conglomerate and said he wrote the characters based on colleagues, as well as himself.The last book in the series follows a general manager surnamed Song, who had already secured “financial freedom” by investing in land in his 20s. The character is more than 95 percent based on the author himself. He wrote that he wanted to get out of poverty and observed a good friend of his father suddenly becoming ""rich"" thanks to a piece of land he owned.Ultimately the book offers a chance to reflect on what it means to be a father, mother, son or daughter living in South Korea today. Some people see their fathers in this book, who after years of hard work are left with an uncertain post-retirement life.“I really hate Department Head Kim, but at the same time I feel uncomfortable because he really resembles me,” one review on the Kyobo Bookstore website reads.Another review says, “I picked up this book for some investment techniques. But the man who neglects his family, devotes himself to his work and always thinks he is right resembles my father. In a way, he seemed to represent my father's time. I felt for them … I regret that I never hugged my father when he came back home from work looking tired.”""Some of the most common comments I receive are that Kim seems like their father or that they have lived like Kim,"" Song said. ""While portraying characters realistically, I hoped that people working day in and day out will realize there is something beyond what you see from the outside and the need to prepare for life after retirement.” "

Meet the woman behind girl group IVE who dared to redefine the productio...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000033504?sid=106,"Thu, 05 Jan 2023 16:34:00 +0900","   Seo Hyun-joo, 50, vice president of Starship Entertainment [STARSHIP ENTERTAINMENT]     Seo Hyun-joo, the 50-year-old vice president of Starship Entertainment, ""dared"" to doubt IVE, the 4th-generation girl group that is leading the K-pop scene.      IVE debuted in 2021 with “Eleven” and has been making headlines since. The band has been praised for its catchy music and top-notch choreography, becoming one of the most notable acts in the K-pop industry.    But for Seo, who took part in every detail of the casting, concept-setting and promotion steps for IVE, the question always lingered, “Is this really right?”      “The process was not easy and I still have a lot of doubts,” said Seo.      But after a successful start, Seo is already set on making another smash-hit to follow the widely-popular “After Like.”      Standing at the forefront of the K-pop production frontier, Seo recently sat down for an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo, an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily, to talk more about the production process.    The following are edited excerpts of that interview.       Girl group IVE [STARSHIP ENTERTAINMENT]     Q. How was the casting process for the members of IVE?      A. During the final audition process, Starship Entertainment examines whether the people auditioning have a unique charm along with basic understanding and skills needed for the industry. IVE is a case where each member has so many different characteristics and charms and has enough qualities to come together in harmony.   First of all, we saw in member Yujin a potential to firmly support the group by being what we call an “all-rounder,” in that she has an overall holistic set of skills and talents. In the case of Gaeul, she has been working hard ever since she was a trainee, and Rei, who is Japanese, has great command of Korean and a lovely singing voice. I was attracted to Wonyoung’s sparkling star-quality character and her constant effort to maintain that quality, and Liz’s attractive clear tone and Yiseo’s seriousness and passion were what caught our eyes.  Is it true that you hand-picked Ahn Yu-jin yourself?      Yujin applied to Starship through an online audition. When we saw that audition video, we thought to ourselves, “We have to bring her in no matter what.” I had a business trip planned coincidentally near her hometown — Daejeon — so we contacted her parents and immediately signed a contract. Every day as I see her growing up to be such a beautiful young lady, it reminds me that we made a great choice in casting her.  What did you think immediately after seeing the reaction after IVE debuted?      I was really grateful to our members who put faith in me and followed my production direction well, and to all the executives and employees at Starship who accompanied me through the process. When a debut song hits the streaming services and music platforms, the pressure for the next album inevitably increases, but I wanted to show listeners and fans a newer and better image rather than just quickly putting out the next song.  What’s IVE's world view? (A world view in K-pop is the central message or point of view that a group wants to rely through their music and performances.)      In the production stage, we focused more on setting up and showing the identities of the group members rather than setting a world view. IVE’s identity can be defined as “confident girls who have become independent on the basis of self-love,” and through this, we sought to represent the current younger generation. I think this identity was why some people have called the IVE world view something close to narcissism.       IVE member Ahn Yu-jin during an episode of ″Voyage,″ a JTBC reality show. [JTBC]     Is there a part of the production process that best reflects a female producer’s point of view?      Rather than a woman’s point of view, as a producer, I thought a lot about what kind of message to convey through IVE and through the group’s stage performances and songs. After discussing various aspects with our team at Starship, I thought that IVE’s self-reliant attitude and confidence coupled with high self-esteem match well with the direction IVE wants to go in the future.  Is “Love Dive” a song for IVE’s fan club DIVE?      There is a line in the lyrics of the song that goes, “If you want, dare to jump in.” There is a very bold and challenging nuance to that phrase, and I thought that the fans and the general public who listen to IVE’s songs would find it interesting, so we decided on the title “Love Dive.” In the song's composition, there is a variation on the dance break, and the title could have been “Loved IVE,” which is also reminiscent of the fandom name DIVE. We intentionally made these variations possible through the production process.  How do you view the relationship between IVE and DIVE?      The relationship between K-pop idols and fandoms centers on the “reason for existence” for each other. The part that can best show this is IVE’s greeting slogan, “DIVE into IVE.” Because the name of the fandom is within the slogan itself, it connects IVE and DIVE in every moment and strengthens the bond.  How do you balance between targeting the fandom and the larger public?      IVE’s debut song was able to garner a lot of popularity and became a hit, which we are very thankful for. I saw the process of listeners becoming a fan after first liking IVE’s songs. In the end, the positive effect of well-made content seems to give a K-pop group the opportunity to catch two birds — general popularity and a loyal fandom — with one stone.   There is a fierce 4th generation girl group war going on. What are IVE’s strengths?      First, we plan to show listeners and fans alike how we will stick to our values but will always be changing. From IVE’s debut song “Eleven” to “Live Dive” and “After Like,” all of the group’s songs have different colors, and it is difficult to predict what will come next for IVE. We hope this will increase the curiosity of listeners and the general public about IVE. But the core values that the group holds will not be shaken. Secondly, I think that the attitude that IVE members have are the group’s strengths. IVE’s unique characteristic is its high self-esteem attitude that all of the members have, which is filled with self-confidence not only on the outside but also on the inside.       Girl group IVE [STARSHIP ENTERTAINMENT]     What are the characteristics of 4th-generation girl groups, in your opinion?      The central characteristic of the new generation of girl groups seems to be diversity. Girl groups have become diverse in all aspects, including songs, lyrics, performances, visuals and content. Additionally, each group pursues its own uniqueness and embodies it wonderfully.  What is the most important thing in K-pop production?      I focus on three points when working on production: setting a new standard on what is ‘classic,’ an approach that fits the current trend, and communication with fans. In other words, we try to pursue new but authentic values that idol fandoms have come to prize, but also look at new media and old media at the same time in order to approach trends in terms of promotion and marketing. Above all, fan opinions and monitoring reactions have become a central axis of all decision-making at Starship Entertainment.  Has your view of girl groups changed compared to the past?      Rather than a change in the status of girl groups, I definitely sense that the status of K-pop itself has changed. At the time group Sistar was being produced, I thought that the domestic market was everything, but now my perspective has broadened to include the global market. Thanks to fans who love K-pop from all over the world, proposals for collaboration that we could not even imagine before are flooding in. Now I feel that I am standing on a stage that I previously only dreamt of. I am very grateful for this.  Did you feel there were limits to the overseas reach that groups could achieve?      Nowadays, from the moment of debut, we set up plans for domestic and overseas goals and strive to implement them. However, during production in the Sistar days, I thought that we had to achieve success domestically first before turning to foreign markets. But now, with the onset of social media and platforms including YouTube, the K-pop market has grown above time and space constraints. We are thinking now about how to target both the domestic and foreign markets together.     Girl group IVE [STARSHIP ENTERTAINMENT]        Will active overseas expansion help girl groups extend their shelf lives?      As the overall market has grown so much, the growth phrase has become longer and fandoms have expanded. Because of this, I think that the activity cycles of idol groups, including girl groups, will become longer.  How do you choose ‘good’ songs?      There are songs that make us at Starship feel like “This is it” when we first listen to it. I don’t really fixate on a certain style or genre, but I look for songs that I think would be good to listen to for a long time. Songs are selected by matching them to the artists’ growth roadmaps. After selecting a song, it proceeds in the form of “working backward” — a product planning methodology first coined at Amazon. First, we imagine what would happen if we reach number one on music charts with that particular song, then reflect on why this song would become popular and apply it to our production process. Lyrics, choreography, timeliness, trends and every other factor are verified. We write a press release for a song reaching number one then identify the success factors that way.  Are more female producers coming to forefront these days?      Many women have been active in the K-pop industry for a long time. Recently, it seems that we have started to receive more attention. The people I worked with when I first started out in this industry have become producers, and I am very happy to be with them at this moment in time in the industry. Women producers are leading K-pop and the K-culture by producing representative artists of our time. And producers are rewarded not only for the achievements of their artists but also for well-trained staff members who they work with at entertainment companies. Behind the glitz and success of the artist themselves, I always think about how to help out people who will step on the accelerator for the industry to grow even more in the future.  There is a perception that girl groups produced from a woman’s point of view will be different. How is it in reality?      Of course, there are differences in the perspective given by gender and those points of view. However, each producer has a different perspective individually and we can’t be defined by whether we are men or women. The most important point of view from my perspective is understanding of the artists themselves. Speaking from my own experiences, I try to have a lot of different conversations with the working staff, too. I tend to try to communicate more comfortably about how the staff think, breathe and collaborate with the artists. It seems that a more delicate production environment is being created in the industry. It is often said that the market grows when consumers are sensitive, but fans who love K-pop have higher standards than in any other industry. As we are exposed to a more global environment, various points of concern or potential for issues that we have not thought of before are arising. That’s why a delicate and communicative working environment and constant conversation between those working on groups is helpful.  There has been talk of Starship Entertainment being listed on the Korean stock market. Would IVE’s achievements advance such ambitions?      Starship has been growing ever since its establishment. Going public is also part of that process. I think we were able to keep moving forward because we have talented and solid artists such as K.Will, Monsta X, WJSN, Jeong Se-woon, Cravity, and of course IVE. I think these efforts are advancing a positive future for the company.   "
[Peter Singer] In defense of the art-targeting climate activists,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000242710?sid=104,"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 05:34:00 +0900","Last July, two activists from Just Stop Oil entered London’s National Gallery and made their way to John Constable’s “The Hay Wain,” an iconic painting of rural England as it was 200 years ago. After covering the painting with an image of environmental destruction, they glued their hands to the frame and awaited arrest.Three months later, another pair of activists went to the National Gallery and threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh’s “Sunflowers.” In the Netherlands, one activist glued his head to Johannes Vermeer’s “Girl with a Pearl Earring,” while another poured something red over him. In Vienna, members of Last Generation, an organization named to make the point that we are the last generation able to prevent catastrophic climate change, poured black oily liquid over Gustav Klimt’s “Death and Life.” And in Potsdam, others smeared mashed potatoes onto Claude Monet’s “Haystacks.”In all these incidents, the activists chose paintings protected by glass, drawing attention to great works of art, but not damaging them. With “The Hay Wain,” the message was that if we do not stop using fossil fuels, scenes like the one Constable painted will be gone forever.The title of the Klimt reminds us that climate change is a life-and-death issue. The activists used the “Girl with a Pearl Earring” to challenge our values, asking the shocked onlookers how they felt when they saw the beautiful painting apparently being ruined. “Do you feel outraged?” they asked -- and then answered their own question, “Good. Where is that feeling when you see the planet being destroyed before your very eyes?”We value art, but what we stand to lose from climate change is incomparably more significant. Everything we value on this planet is at stake, including the continuity of both human and non-human life. Why, then, do many people support the goal of stronger action against climate change, yet oppose the actions taken by Just Stop Oil and Last Generation?It’s happened before. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” is a response to eight white clergymen who, writing in a Birmingham, Alabama, newspaper, had agreed with King’s goals, but not with his “extreme” actions (which were entirely non-violent). They urged King to wait patiently for “a more convenient season.” King replied that he found this lukewarm acceptance “more bewildering than outright rejection.” Eco-activists may experience a similar bewilderment when they are criticized by people who say that they share their goals but object to their non-violent attempts, which, while taking care to avoid damaging the art, seek to raise awareness of the importance of avoiding fossil fuels.We honor many protesters, past and present, who broke the law to advance a good cause. Suffragettes targeted great art in their struggle to obtain votes for women, and, unlike today’s eco-activists, deliberately slashed paintings. Today, however, we regard them as heroic feminist pioneers. In the United States, King’s birthday is a federal holiday. We support the courageous women of Iran in their protests against the theocracy there. And yet we do not also support non-violent protests against government policies that are manifestly insufficient to achieve the goal, embodied in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels?In seeking a conviction against the people who glued their hands to the frame of “The Hay Wain,” the prosecutor sought to distinguish the actions of the suffragettes from those of the activists on trial by saying that the former “had no democratic means by which they could further their cause,” whereas today “We have an established democracy.”Yet activists for climate change have a powerful response to this argument. Today, it seems self-evident that democracy requires allowing women to vote, but not much more than a century ago, conservatives argued that women had no need to vote because their interests were already protected by their husbands or fathers. We laugh at that argument now, but we may be equally blind to serious flaws in our own democracies.Ask yourself who will suffer the most if we fail to prevent catastrophic climate change. The answer is the young and those yet to be born -- both categories unrepresented in our political systems. In “Justice Across Ages,” Juliana Uhuru Bidadanure, a professor at Stanford University, cites statistics showing that even among people old enough to vote, those aged 18-35 are significantly unrepresented in legislatures. In the US, this bias against the young is built into the constitution, which restricts membership of the House of Representatives and the Senate to those who are at least 25 and 30 years old, respectively, and the US president may not be younger than 35.For countries that do not have constitutional barriers against younger legislators, Bidadanure suggests a remedy. Following the example of countries that have quotas to ensure a voice for indigenous people, or other minorities, we could have quotas for younger people. Thomas Wells, of the Leiden Institute for Philosophy, has suggested electing representatives who serve as trustees for future generations. And, of course, we could lower the voting age, to 16 or even lower.In the absence of any such measures, eco-activists can properly claim that their non-violent civil disobedience is justified by the failure of our democracies to show sufficient concern for the interests of future generations. Like the suffragettes more than a century ago, today’s young people have no voice.Peter SingerPeter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University, is founder of the charity The Life You Can Save. -- Ed.(Project Syndicate)"
"Get snap happy, Korean style, at a 'four-cut' photo booth",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000033410?sid=102,"Tue, 03 Jan 2023 19:09:00 +0900","  A Life4Cut studio on Apgujeong Rodeo street [LEE DA-EUN]      New arrivals in Korea might initially be surprised by the plethora of photo booths and self-portrait-studios on the streets. Make a few friends in their teens or 20s, however, and prepare to be inundated with a never-ending stream of printed photo strips as you skim through their Instagram stories. So what exactly are these photo booths and why are they so popular in Korea? One of the popular photo booths — similar to a passport photo booth but much more fun — known as Life4Cut was launched in Korea in 2017. This booth allowed people to take their own photos and print two copies of four small frames on a long vertical strip, similar to a bookmark, for only 4,000 won ($2.80). This analog manner of taking photos grew immensely popular with young Koreans, and numerous studios such as Photogray, Photoism, Harufilm, Selfix and more hopped on the photo strip trend, known in Korea as four-cut photos.    Although there are distinct features for each type of photo booth, there are some common characteristics. All of these booths offer natural photoshop features, special seasonal photo frames, unique photo props to enhance the experience and QR codes that provide a digital copy of the photos taken.       A four-cut photo made at Insaeng-nae-cut [LEE DA-EUN]      Now, what are the specific reasons Koreans are so obsessed with taking these photos? One of the major reasons is that these photo booths provide a relatively cheap way to capture lasting memories with friends and loved ones.      Jeong Min-kyung, a student at Seoul National University, says that she enjoys taking four-cut photos because she “finds the professional camera equipment and printing service a very cost-effective way of permanently capturing youthful memories with friends.”      “I take four-cut photos because it’s cheap and it prints your picture for you,” said Kim Ha-min, an Instagram influencer studying at Korea University.    Another reason for the popularity of instant photo booths is that they are a unique way to capture and express one’s individuality, especially on social media.      ""Photo booths are the optimal self-promotion tool for young people these days, who are constantly aware of how others view them and try to create their best image on social media,” said Jeong.    In fact, taking four-cut photos is an easy way to hop on social media trends as there are numerous special poses and frames that come and go.    Kim Eun-seo, a senior at Korea University who finds herself taking at least one four-cut photo a week, comments that she participated in several social media trends regarding four-cut photos such as using the QR codes to upload digital versions and short video clips of photo sessions.    The photo booths also reflect Generation Z’s pursuit of a more “analog atmosphere” in contrast to their very digital lives. Gen Z, or people born between the mid-to-late 1990s to the early 2010s, are most likely immersed in digital culture and less familiar with analog photography. In Korea, however, the younger generation is increasingly interested in a more analog culture and atmosphere, as they pursue film photography and instant self-photo booths.      According to Kim Eun-seo, her interest in these photo booths is partly due to this rising analog culture among young Koreans.    “Capturing moments through printed photos creates a more special and memorable experience than simply taking photos on my phone,” said Kim. “I like to feel as if I’m part of the analog generation.”      Kim takes these printed photos to decorate her wall and also stores some of them in an album made for four-cut photos.     “Looking back at these captured moments on my wall and in my album makes me feel content and also a bit nostalgic,” she remarks.      Despite being part of the digital generation, Kim Ha-min is also optimistic about the advantages of instant printed photos. He says they are “more convenient and more practical” in the sense of immediately allowing access to hard copies, and “more memorable” as they provide a more physical, tangible experience.      Hair styling tools and mirrors at photo booths  [LEE DA-EUN]     Lee Hoik, the CEO of LK Ventures who launched and trademarked the Life4Cut business, says there are more reasons for the popularity of photo booths.    ""A key phrase that represents Life4Cut is ‘together with many,’"" said Lee. ""The opportunity to get ‘together with many’ friends, capture the memories of that day with witty poses and props in a special place, and record the precious moment in printed photos to stimulate a more analog sense is why Koreans are so attracted to photo booths.""    Life4Cut was not the very first photo booth to become popular in Korea. The start of these instant photo booths can be traced back to Japanese sticker photo booths that became popular in Korea in the late 90s. The younger generation was enthralled by these instant photo booths, as this was before the wide use of digital devices that could take photos.     They used sticker photos to capture lasting moments with their loved ones and decorate their diaries. The sticker photo trend started to die out in the early 2000s with the rise of smartphones and other digital devices that took their place.      Lee comments on how photo booths are like a modern extension of this sticker photo culture.     “We can compare photo booths to the sticker photo booths of the past,"" said Lee. ""Gen Z has not experienced the analog sticker photo culture and is living in a world that is 100 percent digital.""     ""Life4Cut is necessary because it allows them to experience and fulfill their nostalgic longing for this analog atmosphere.”    In response to what exactly sets analog photos apart from digital, Lee adds, “Anyone can take digital photos on their phone, but making memories in a more analog atmosphere can be a new experience for Generation Z, which in this sense, photo booths can be viewed as more suitable to the needs of the current era.”    Although the photo booth craze might seem like a solely Korean culture, foreigners have also hopped on the trend. One studio that is particularly popular among foreigners living in Korea is Photo Drink, another photo booth launched by Lee’s company last year.     Photo Drink has a flashy interior with neon lighting and mirror balls hanging from the ceiling and several trendy photo zones that people can enjoy. It also provides a variety of customizable photo booths with four main themes — bust shot, full shot, dynamic and metal — each allowing customers to take and print photos in a unique and entertaining atmosphere.      The Photo Drink sign and interior [LEE DA-EUN]      Lee is optimistic that the photo booth culture can continue to grow among non-Koreans.     “Foreigners really like Photo Drink,"" said Lee. ""Photo Drink’s charm is that it provides a wide selection from which you can customize your photos.""     ""There are different kinds of missions — you can dance, take trendy photos under diverse lighting and find a way to express your individuality — which is why I think it is popular with foreigners.”    Now that you are more familiar with the photo booth culture in Korea, the last question you might ask is — how can I truly make the most of this vibrant photo culture?    First, enjoy your day and hang out with your friends at a popular restaurant and cafe. As you make your way toward your next destination, stop by a photo booth on the street. Try out the various photo props to create a theme for your photo. For example, you could choose similar animal headbands, trendy sunglasses or seasonal props such as pumpkin hair pieces or Santa’s hats.     Fix your hair and makeup with the tools provided such as a hair iron, brush and large mirror. Look at the numerous printed photos stuck on the walls and decide which size and cut you would prefer for this photo.      Various props at photo booths [LEE DA-EUN]      Check out each stall and choose the one with the background color that best fits your theme. Before taking the photos, try to decide the poses in advance with your friends, as there is usually a ten second time limit for each photo. Of course, if you want a more candid photo shoot, you can choose to go with your instincts on the spot. Select your decided number, size, cut and frame and make sure to choose the QR code option before paying.    When taking the photos, try to go close to the camera to allow for better lighting. After the short photo session, choose the filter or color that fits best and print away! Slip your photo strips into the plastic sleeve provided to protect the photos, and use the QR code to view the digital version of your photo shoot. Post a picture of your photo strips or the digital version on social media and enjoy!  "

Samsung Electronics Announces Third Quarter 2021 Results,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002112465?sid=105,"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 13:13:00 +0900","- Record quarterly revenue of KRW 73.98 trillion, operating profit at KRW 15.82 trillion   Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, October 28, 2021- Samsung Electronics today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021.   Total consolidated revenue was a quarterly record of KRW 73.98 trillion, a 10% increase from a year earlier, which was the previous high. Operating profit increased 26% from the previous quarter to KRW 15.82 trillion, the second-highest ever, as favorable market conditions continued in the memory market while the foundry and display businesses achieved robust sales. The finished product businesses also posted solid performances.   The Memory Business saw a significant improvement in earnings with record quarterly bit shipment, as well as the second-highest revenue for DRAM, and the Foundry Business’s results improved due to strong sales to global customers. For the Display Panel Business, earnings rose as major smartphone customers launched new products.   The Mobile Communications Business saw a sequential improvement in earnings on the back of strong demand for new foldable models and low- to mid-range smartphones as well as growth from tablets and wearables. The Networks Business expanded its global business, including in North America and Japan, and continued to grow 5G network installations in the domestic market.   The Consumer Electronics Division saw strong expansion of the premium TV and Bespoke product lineup, but profitability declined due to rising raw materials and logistics costs.   The strength in most currencies against the Korean won, with the US dollar in particular, had a positive impact of approximately KRW 800 billion on operating profit compared to the previous quarter.   The Company’s capital expenditures in the third quarter reached KRW 10.2 trillion, including KRW 9.1 trillion spent on semiconductors and KRW 0.7 trillion on displays. Total capital expenditures so far in 2021 were KRW 33.5 trillion, including KRW 30 trillion for semiconductors and KRW 2.1 trillion for displays.   The Semiconductor businesses posted KRW 26.41 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 10.06 trillion in operating profit in the third quarter.   For the Memory Business, the overall price situation remained favorable and the Company set a new record for quarterly bit shipment and the second-highest revenue for DRAM, backed in particular by significant growth in server sales.   For DRAM, server demand continued to grow as adoption of a new, high-core CPU which was released in the first half of the year. PC demand from end-users has also been robust due to changes such as workplaces opting for hybrid work patterns, and mobile demand recovery has become more visible thanks to releases of new products by major manufacturers and the base effect of the previous quarter.   Despite a resurgence of COVID-19 in major production countries and component supply issues that led to disruptions in set builds, Samsung actively responded to DRAM demand by flexibly operating its product mix.    For NAND, server SSDs demand recovered along with increased investments by major server customers, and demand from data centers for high-capacity products was strong based on the high-capacity trend spurred by new CPU adoptions. Mobile demand has been solid due to the launch of new models.   Looking to the fourth quarter for DRAM, the fundamental demand for server is expected to stay strong thanks to the new CPU adoption and expansion of datacenter investments. However, Samsung will keep monitoring impacts of the component supply issues on set builds.   For Mobile, manufacturers are likely to continue to launch new 5G models but there are chances that growth of purchasing demand could be limited due to inventory adjustments at some customers along with impacts of supply chain issues. For PC, Set build growth to stay similar compared to the last quarter.   As for NAND, server SSD demand is expected to be robust as business activities normalize and continued growth in enterprise IT budgets and the high-capacity trend for server SSD.   For the outlook next year, while macro uncertainties, such as the timing of mitigating component supply issues, influences of “Living with COVID-19” policies amid increasing vaccination rates, and raw material pricing issues, make it difficult to provide specific guidance, server and PC demand is expected to be robust with the trend toward high-capacity following the expanding new CPU adoption and continued growth of enterprise IT investments. For Mobile, the Company expect shipment growth and the high capacity trend to continue with the increase in low-end to mid-range 5G models, and also as manufacturers launch products with new form factors.   Samsung will continue to expand the portion of 15-nm DRAM and 128 layer V-NAND, proactively address the server market where demand is likely to grow thanks to new adoptions of DDR5 with rising penetration of a high core CPU and also preemptively secure demand for NAND solution products.   Moreover, while expanding mass production of 14-nm DRAM and 176 layer V-NAND, the Company will continue to strengthen its market competitiveness via cost reductions through next-generation processes and products.   The System LSI Business saw its earnings improve in the third quarter thanks to increased demand for SoCs/DDIs as major mobile customers launched new products. In the third quarter, the Company launched the industry’s first 200-megapixel image sensor for mobile phones and the industry's smallest dual pixel image sensor.   In the fourth quarter, the Company expects earnings to continue to increase due to expanded supply of SoCs and related products for launches of new 5G smartphones in 2022.     The System LSI Business will improve its performance next year by expanding supply of 5G SoC products for the volume zone as well as for new flagship products that feature enhanced GPU performance.   The Foundry Business saw its earnings improve sequentially, posting record revenue for the quarter as supply of key advanced process products increased. The Company also secured a stable revenue base by winning new orders for advanced processes from global customers.   In the fourth quarter, demand for advanced and mature processes look to remain strong, and the Company expects to post a new quarterly record for revenue, increasing more than 10% from the third quarter. The Company plans to continue its technological leadership by completing the design of first-generation 3-nm products based on GAA and developing second-generation 3-nm GAA process.   In 2022, the foundry market is expected to remain tight due to high silicon consumption for 5G in mobile and strong GPU-led demand for HPCs. The Company plans to improve earnings significantly by expanding supply of advanced processes of sub 5-nm process as well as increasing sales to global customers and normalizing prices for sustainable future investment.   The Display Panel Business posted KRW 8.86 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.49 trillion in operating profit for the third quarter. Overall display earnings improved compared to the previous quarter primarily due to the strong sales of small to mid-sized OLED panels despite weak performance in the large display business.    Mobile display earnings rose amid favorable seasonal effects, driven by demand for newly launched products from major smartphone customers. Especially, sales expansion for high-end products including foldable phones contributed to highest-ever third quarter profit. However, the large display business continued to post losses mainly due to price declines in LCD panels.   Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, for mobile displays, Samsung forecasts strong demand for new smartphones to continue and sales for laptops and gaming devices to grow during the holiday season. Thus, it expects the earnings to remain solid for the fourth quarter. In the large display business, as the Company is all set to begin mass production of QD displays, it will focus on the successful introduction of its first QD products to the market.   In 2022, a favorable environment for the OLED business is expected to continue, thanks to the recovery of smartphone market demand and the higher adoption of 5G phones. Moreover, sales of applications such as laptops and tablets are forecast to grow in earnest. Samsung will strive to turn such momentum into a new growth engine for the Company. Also, amid concerns over supply of some components such as DDIs, the Company will closely monitor its supply chain and take preemptive actions to potential risks to ensure uninterrupted product delivery.   For the large displays, Samsung will complete the business reorganization from LCD to QD displays as planned and focus on securing leadership in the premium TV segment with QD displays.   The IT & Mobile Communications Division posted KRW 28.42 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.36 trillion in operating profit for the third quarter.    Overall market demand increased from the previous quarter due to alleviating influences of COVID-19. Despite a component supply constraints across the industry, the Mobile Communications Business saw revenue increase from the second quarter. Smartphone sales increased compared to the previous quarter thanks to strong sales of flagship models including Galaxy Z Fold3 and Galaxy Z Flip3, as well as enhanced mass-market lineup. Device Ecosystem products such as wearables have also continued material growth. While increased marketing investments for the foldable category had some effect on profitability, the Company secured solid double-digit operating profit margin.   Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, market demand is forecast to increase quarter-on-quarter due to strong year-end seasonality, however, uncertainties over component supply are likely to persist. The Company will strive to maintain a double-digit operating profit margin by further expanding premium smartphone sales with the Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke Edition while also continuing sales momentum of Galaxy S series. At the same time, the Company will pro-actively target replacement demand with competitive mass-market 5G lineup, and increase sales of Device Ecosystem products such as wearables, PCs and tablets.   In 2022, amid uncertainties over COVID-19, the smartphone and wearable markets are expected to continue growing. The Mobile Communications Business aims to reinforce its leadership in the premium segment by driving the mainstreaming of the foldable category providing innovative technology and differentiated experience such as Galaxy Z Flip3 Bespoke Edition. With these efforts, the Company will strive to achieve solid performance by strengthening mass-market 5G lineup and Device Ecosystem business.   For the mid-to-long term future growth, the Company will continue its efforts to develop advanced technologies and collaborate with leading global companies.   As for the Networks Business, the Company expanded its business overseas including North America and Japan, and actively responded to 5G expansion in South Korea. The Company will continue with its network rollouts in Korea while exploring new business opportunities overseas including North America, Japan, South West Asia, and Europe. By improving the in-house 5G chip and advancing 5G virtualization solutions, the Company will strive to strengthen its product competitiveness and solidify foundations for growth.   The Consumer Electronics Division, comprised of the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses, recorded KRW 14.10 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.76 trillion in operating profit in the third quarter.    Despite strong sales of its premium TVs and Bespoke home appliance products, the Company recorded lower profits both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, due to a significant rise in material and logistics costs.   Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the Company expects higher demand for TVs quarter-on-quarter due to year-end seasonality. However, year-on-year demand is expected to decrease as more regions adopt “Living with COVID-19” policies and pent-up demand effects continue to fade. Samsung plans to respond by focusing on premium product sales, with optimized year-end promotions for both its offline and online channels.   In 2022, the Company expects the growth trend to continue to slow, as consumers increasingly spend less time at home. However, a heightened interest in customized, premium lifestyle products is expected to remain, which the Company plans to actively address. Further product mix enhancement, global market expansion, retail and marketing optimization, and strengthened SCM capabilities are key elements of Samsung’s plan.		"
(CES) Samsung-CES 2023,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0013680965?sid=104,"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0900","(CES) Samsung's new TVs, fridges get smarter with incremental new features By Woo Jae-yeon   LAS VEGAS, Jan. 3 (Yonhap) -- There were few big surprises and eye-popping innovations at Samsung Electronics' media events Tuesday, where its latest home gadgets were on full display ahead of the opening of CES 2023.    To be fair, the South Korean tech giant did upgrade existing home appliances with new features, aimed at making people's lives easier and smarter.    At the two events -- The First Look and Bespoke Private Showcase -- Samsung unveiled what kind of TVs and kitchen appliances it has in store for this year.   Samsung's new high-end TVs come with more enhanced connectivity and features that enable a personalized viewing experience, the company said, as part of efforts to push the boundaries of traditional TV.   Samsung said its new Neo QLED TVs are powered by the Neural Quantum Processor, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve image.   They are also fitted with an algorithm to apply real-time High Dynamic Range effects for the first time to show a more realistic image with more contrast, brightness and color than before.   The new Neo QLED TV supports Matter, a new industry standard for smart home platforms, apps and devices, meaning that users can easily connect third party devices to the Samsung TV.Media members take a tour of Samsung Electronics Co.'s exhibition hall at a hotel in Las Vegas on Jan. 3, 2023. (Yonhap)""In 2023, we are pushing the boundaries of innovation to offer consumers more than just premium picture quality, but a holistic, premium device experience tailored to what they need and want out of their connected home,"" said Kim Cheol-gi, executive vice president of the Visual Display Business at Samsung.   Samsung presented an expanded lineup of Micro LED TVs from 50 inches to 140 inches, with five sizes in between. It also added a 77-inch OLED model to its OLED TV lineup. Samsung launched its first OLED TV last year in two sizes -- 55 and 65 inches.      The company also unveiled a new refrigerator with a 32-inch large screen -- nearly double the size of the previous models -- that serves as a communication and entertainment hub.   On the screen, users can monitor and control other connected home appliances, as well as watch entertainment programs.   Samsung said it planned to launch My Bespoke service, which enables users to design their own fridge panels, in the United States during the first quarter of this year. The company was reviewing whether to introduce it in South Korea.   Bespoke took up around 25 percent of all refrigerators sold in the U.S. last year and has been getting increasingly popular, the company said.   Meanwhile, Samsung expanded the use of its popular portable projector, The Freestyle. Now consumers can use two units of The Freestyle at the same time to watch content in a 21:9 configuration with no manual lining or adjusting.   The Freestyle, first unveiled at CES 2022, is a light, portable screen and entertainment device, especially aimed at Generation Z and millenials, with no separate screen required and the cradle rotating up to 180 degrees to enable users to see video anywhere from tables to ceilings.A Samsung employee explains the new Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator with Family Hub at a hotel in Las Vegas on Jan. 3, 2023.

"[Kim Seong-kon] James Bond and older men’s wisdom, knowledge",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000126161?sid=104,"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 19:41:00 +0900"," As I grow older, I begin to look back upon my past with remorse and regret. During my lifetime, I must have done quite a few good things and did others favors numerous times. Sadly, however, I am oblivious of all the good things I have done and can only think of all the mistakes I have made, whether unwittingly or intentionally. Full of regrets, I often whisper to myself silently, “I shouldn’t have done that. How could I have been such an imbecile?”  Perhaps the peculiar psychological phenomenon stems from the feeling that you are no longer young and there is nothing much left to choose in your future life. So you feel you should redeem your past mistakes and straighten them out before you leave this world. Or it means you have now acquired the so-called old man’s wisdom of life through the numerous mistakes you made when you were young and impetuous.When you try to convey your wisdom to the young, however, they would immediately dismiss it as nothing but an old man’s meddling and nagging. Under the banner of anti-institutional liberalism, progressivism and counter-culture, it is the young people’s privilege to revolt against the older generation. “We, too, were once young just like you,” old people would sigh out their discontent. “And we, too, believed we were absolutely right and the older generation totally wrong. Later, however, we realized we were wrong from the beginning.” But young people would turn a deaf ear to the older people’s wisdom and advice. Although there are things you cannot possibly fathom unless you actually experienced them, the young would never admit it.The other day, I met a young man who was a huge fan of the James Bond movies. “Did you see the latest ‘007’ movie?” he asked me. “No, I haven’t.” I answered. Actually, I am also a big fan of James Bond, but I was no longer interested in the “007” movies for several reasons. No longer a product of the Cold War era, the “007” movies today have become just action-packed movies which gravely lack the subtlety and suspense of the original spy movies in which Sean Connery starred in the 1960s. Other actors who played James  Bond such as Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan were also good, but the “007” films in which they appeared were not as impeccably good as the ones in which Sean Connery acted out as the legendary MI6 British agent. The reason is relatively simple; the Cold War era is over now.Another reason was that the image of Daniel Craig was far from the image of James Bond that Ian Fleming originally depicted in his novels. Fleming describes Bond as a tall, dark and handsome man with thick eyebrows and a keen sense of humor ― a man who looks a little cold-blooded but not without a warm and gentle smile. Surely it was not Daniel Craig but Sean Connery who perfectly fits the image of Fleming’s James Bond. In his three “007” movies, for example, Craig never seems to smile or cast a joke. Instead, he viciously attacks and kills his opponents in a cold-blooded manner like that of a raging bull. Craig is always much too serious and rancorous, gravely lacking the subtle qualities of the original James Bond.While I was brooding over those things, the “007” fan asked me, “As James Bond, I think Pierce Brosnan suits better than Daniel Craig, don’t you think?” “I agree,’’ I replied. “But I think Sean Connery is absolutely the best James Bond ever. You should see his ‘From Russia with Love.’” Suddenly, I noticed that he did not know that Sean Connery was the original James Bond. He had not heard of “From Russia with Love” either. Ah, he belonged to the Pierce Brosnan generation! How then could he know who Sean Connery is? But I decided to go on anyway, because it occurred to me that perhaps it would be an older man’s responsibility or protocol to let the younger people know of the history. So I continued, “You should read Fleming’s novels.” “What? Were the ‘007’ movies based on novels?” he seemed to be genuinely surprised. So he had not heard of Ian Fleming either. “Not the recent ones,” I answered. “They ran out of Fleming’s novels. Besides, Fleming’s novels do not fit in the post-Cold War era.”  It was at the very moment when I realized that it surely would be my generation’s duty to let the younger people know about things of the past, which we were well immersed with, for we actually experienced them. Otherwise, our younger people, who do not have a clue about, say, the Korean War, would dare to educate us on what the Korean War really was, even though they knew we had lived through it. To prevent this kind of inversion of civilization, we have to tell them what we know and experienced, even when they stubbornly refuse to hear.By Kim Seong-kon Kim Seong-kon is a professor of English at Seoul National University and president of the Literature Translation Institute of Korea. ― Ed.

K-pop girl group marketing becomes premium and pricey,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000033187?sid=106,"Wed, 28 Dec 2022 16:44:00 +0900","   IVE is shown wearing Miu Miu during an appearance on MBC's weekly music ranking program ""Show! Music Core"" last April for its song ""Love Dive."" [SCREEN CAPTURE]     On Nov. 28, 1997, three young girls climbed on stage during the SBS variety show “Recharge 100% Show” (1996-98, translated). Wearing matching white oversized pants and singing “I’m Your Girl” (1997), S.E.S. sprung up as both SM Entertainment and the K-pop industry’s first-ever girl group.    On Aug. 7 this year, girl group NewJeans performed its new song “Cookie” on SBS’s weekly music ranking show “Inkigayo” (2000-). Although all five members are wearing a school uniform-inspired look, most of the garments are from luxury fashion brands. Minji’s Balenciaga jacket costs 3.3 million won ($2,600) while Hanni’s Prada t-shirt is 1.6 million won. Haerin sported a pair of 530,000 won Rombaut sneakers on stage.    K-pop's prominence during the past 25 years has skyrocketed, and the meaning and portrayal of girl groups has changed significantly. The dynamic of girl groups only targeting the domestic market has changed since the mid-2010s, which is when third-generation acts like BTS, Exo and Blackpink debuted.       S.E.S. wore matching white oversized pants for its performance of “I’m Your Girl” (1997). [SCREEN CAPTURE]     After Twice became the first K-pop girl group to sell over a million copies of an album and Blackpink became the most-subscribed artist on YouTube, with the channel having 83.6 million subscribers as of Dec. 28, the industry has shifted to calculating the profits and losses when managing and promoting girl groups specifically.    The industry says that the cost to debut a rookie group has jumped two to threefold compared with 2015, which was around 1 billion won at the time. STAYC’s producer Rado said last year in a YouTube video that “if you really put in some effort, you need at least 2 billion won.”       [AHN DA-YOUNG]     Fantagio, the agency that manages boy band Astro and girl group Weki Meki, announced last year that it would invest 3.18 billion won to produce another new girl group.    Industry workers estimate that at least 5 billion won was needed to create SM Entertainment’s latest girl group aespa, which debuted in 2020, considering all the investments they would have made for the digital avatars and music videos with movie-like quality.       During the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards in August, Blackpink members each wore outfits of the luxury brand they represent. From left; Lisa in Celine, Jisoo in Dior, Jennie in Chanel and Rosé in Saint Laurent. [MTV]     Even the production scale has expanded to the global stage. Among 15 girl groups that debuted this year, eight have at least one foreign member. Global auditions that were deemed a bit much in the past have now become all but mandatory. When an agency holds auditions internationally, applications flood in — which also helps garner the attention of potential fans.    The “premium” strategy has proved to be crucial in girl group marketing. This is why IVE, barely a year old, wore Italian designer label Miu Miu in their music videos, and NewJeans, also a rookie, donned Vivienne Westwood golf wear during live performances.    It’s nothing new that the four members of Blackpink each already represent high-end fashion brands Chanel, Dior, Celine and Saint Laurent, but this phenomenon is now becoming the new norm.       [AHN DA-YOUNG]     Agencies go the distance to produce fan merchandise that appeals more to the female audience, who are known to open their wallets more in consuming K-pop content.    Girl groups have shifted away from the past lovestruck concepts and started to diversify, particularly starting with the third-generation groups. Their common factor lies in “duality” — a term frequently used among fans referring to when a K-pop star is easily able to pull off contrasting concepts. The singers may seem like idols on the stage, but behind the scenes, they become the girl next door.       NewJeans wore a school uniform-inspired look for its live performance of ″Cookie,″ but most of the garments are from luxury fashion brands. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     “Breaking away from the extremely masculine concept, girl groups have more variety, and as they achieve the million-seller status, it’s aiding them in branching out in the industry,” said music critic Kim Do-heon.    People's favorite K-pop idols are therefore no longer mysterious beings. Drinking, which used to be taboo, is now emerging in entertainment content. On a variety show, ITZY’s Chaeryeong got drunk and talked frankly about her frustration with how her stocks plummeted.    “Although their live performances may be striking and bold, the industry has changed to a new narrative in having them show their friendlier, more down-to-earth image elsewhere,” said Lee Gyu-tag, a professor of cultural studies at George Mason University Korea.

Such aesthetic is referred to as “high teen” in Korea and has been steadily rising to popularity since around the time the Covid-19 pandemic broke out.         Singer Jeon Somi wears a plaid crop top and skirt in her music video for ""Dumb Dumb"" (2021), set in an American-style high school. [THE BLACK LABEL]     “The signature look of high teen fashion is defined by bold colors, patterns and accessories, as well as certain types of clothing such as crop tops,” fashion critic Youn Hae-sook told the Korea JoongAng Daily.      “Not only celebrities but also more young women are dressing themselves in high teen style, especially in youth hotspots like Hongdae. Many still find the fashion too daring for everyday wear, but even they are participating in the trend more subtly with accessories and phone cases.”        Taeyeon of Girls' Generation wears a bright pastel-colored bandana and crop top in her music video for ""Weekend"" (2021). [SCREEN CAPTURE]     High teen fashion is strongly reminiscent of American teen movies from the 1990s, emulating the outfits of the lead characters but with modern and Korean touches added.      “The high teen aesthetic seen in Korea nowadays is directly influenced by American youth fashion in the 1990s to early 2000s,” Youn continued. According to Youn, some of the most iconic American films that have influenced high teen fashion are “Clueless” (1995), Mean Girls” (2004), “Pretty Woman” (1990), “Boyz n the Hood” (1991) and “The Matrix” (1999). In fact, Sunmi's song title ""You can't sit with us"" is an iconic line from ""Mean Girls.""

[PARAMOUNT PICTURES]       Teaser image for STAYC's new EP ""Stereotype"" [HIGHUP ENTERTAINMENT]     Out of all the eras and trends, why are colorful aesthetics from '90s U.S. teen movies trending in the Korean idol scene and fashion today?    “The high teen fad is an extension of ‘Newtro,’” said Lee Dong-hyun, CEO of fashion consulting company FCL Korea. “Newtro” is a portmanteau of ""new” and “retro” which emerged around 2018 to refer to cultural and style elements of bygone eras becoming trendy again.    “It’s quite common for fashion trends to come back after a generation, which is roughly 30 years,” he said. “That’s when the fashion starts feeling new again to youths in their teens and early twenties who haven’t experienced that era. For instance, the retro boom in 2010s Korea represented by the hit film 'Sunny' (2011) was based on trends from the 1980s. A decade later now, the retro fad has moved on to the '90s.”       A scene from singer Sunmi's music video for ""You can't sit with us"" (2021) [SCREEN CAPTURE]     “The analog feeling and free spirit of the 1990s seen in films of that era can feel novel to today’s younger generation who grew up in a digital culture,” said pop culture critic Kim Heon-sik. “The rise of high teen fashion shows that today’s youths are rediscovering '90s pop culture, and it has left an impression on them.""    Youn says this phenomenon is not unique to Korea.      “The West is also seeing a boom in '90s nostalgia and a second heyday of '90s fashion trends,” she said. “Nostalgia for the '90s has become a subculture of its own, even among younger generations who didn’t live through that era. I believe it’s because '90s American pop culture was so iconic, and that’s why young Koreans also find the high teen aesthetic appealing.”    As well as being a fashion trend, high teen is inseparable from teenage identity and fantasies surrounding high school life. Since high teen takes inspiration from teen movies, music videos for “Dumb Dumb” and “Stereotype” are set in what look like American high schools, school cafeterias and at proms, while “Beam Beam” in set at an American-style burger joint. In the videos, the singers dress just like the student protagonists of 1990s teen films.       Soyeon of (G)I-DLE dressed as a waitress in an American-style burger joint in her music video for ""Beam Beam” (2021). [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Such campus-related elements may suggest deeper reasons about why the high teen style is trending, especially considering the pandemic and Korea’s economic recession, according to Kim.      “Since classes turned online, there is practically no campus life for Korean high school and university students alike,” he said. “American high schools are similar to Korean colleges in terms of system, so the high teen trend is embracing not only Korean high school girls but also college-age women who want to vicariously enjoy campus life and the romanticism surrounding it through the aesthetic. Idols are actively embodying this fantasy in the form of high teen fashion.”    “On top of that, youths in Korea today are very dispirited in this harsh economic recession and pandemic,” Kim added. “Bold colors and patterns can be uplifting thanks to their bright and carefree vibe, so it makes sense that today’s youths are drawn to such designs.”       Taeyeon in her music video for ""Weekend"" [SCREEN CAPTURE]     “Since I’m mostly stuck at home due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I've become more interested in decorating my room and belongings with something vivid to brighten up the mood,” said college student Kim Da-ye. “High teen-style designs are not only vivid, but also feel exotic; we can’t express ourselves with fashion in Korean high schools since we wore uniforms. but American high school students can, and that created a certain fantasy about their lifestyle.”    Another fashion keyword that goes hand in hand with the high teen boom is “kitsch,” a term originally used to criticize designs that are excessively decorated and garish, but have gained cult popularity as an aesthetic. The aesthetic is represented by bold, colorful illustrations and collage-style designs.    “Kitsch designs such as bold polka dot patterns or colorful illustrations of cherries are also a key element of high teen fashion,” said Youn. “The rise of kitsch, which was once dismissed as childish, indicates that society has become more accepting of individual tastes. The fashion critiques I used to write years ago mainly focused on what trends certain celebrities were leading, but now more critiques focus on ordinary people who are enjoying diverse fashion styles in their own way.”       A scene from STAYC's music video for ""ASAP"" [SCREEN CAPTURE]       A scene from STAYC's music video for ""ASAP"" [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Considering the young age range of K-pop idol singers and their fans, taking inspiration from teen fashion is neither surprising nor new. But this time, the difference is that the inspiration comes from a more Western idea of teenage life, and the shift also suggests a change in how female K-pop idols are presenting themselves.    “Female idols have been wearing schoolgirl uniforms since the beginning of the idol scene,” said Kim. “But wearing Korean school uniforms and presenting themselves as American-style high school girls have completely different contexts. Korean-style uniforms emphasize an innocent and passive image, which usually appeals to male fans, while being a confident, bratty protagonist of an American teen movie is more appealing to female fans who want vicarious satisfaction.""       Teaser images for STAYC's ""Stereotype"" [HIGHUP ENTERTAINMENT]     ""Since more girl groups like Blackpink are presenting a ‘girl crush’ image rather than appealing to male fans, I believe the Korean-style school uniform look has fallen out of trend and American teen fashion that shows more confidence and personality will be preferred for a while,"" Kim added.    Kim also believes that the high teen trend can be more than just a fashion phase and be an effective strategy for K-pop idols to appeal to a wider audience.    “Since '90s retro aesthetics are trending in other parts of the world too, most notably in Western countries, the current high teen style of female K-pop stars can be received positively by international audiences who are already familiar with '90s American teen aesthetics,"" he said. ""It’s a two-birds-with-one-stone strategy to appeal to domestic female fans with novelty and confidence, and to the international audience with familiarity.""  "
"[WHY] Cool or warm, spring or summer — Koreans want to know, what's in ...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000032709?sid=004,"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 07:00:00 +0900","  Kwak Yoon-gy finds his personal color with a consultant. Left shows Kwak matches well with cool tones and right, his face looks slightly darker with warm tones. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Choosing makeup to complement your style choices can be harder than it seems. Styling for yourself with an objective eye, in particular, is more difficult than suggesting styles for your friends. If you're having difficulty discovering your own personal style or what suits you best, hiring an expert to figure out your “personal color” may be a good place to start. Based on your physical characteristics such as eye color, skin color and hair color, you will be classified into 12 different seasons, and find out what colors look best on you.      Personal color has become a new beauty trend in Korea. People who are not even considered beauty fanatics are pushed by their friends to personal color consultants to find their best colors and try out different cosmetic products based on the results. Personal color consultations are easily found at job fairs and even marriage brokerage companies to help improve people’s first impressions and overall look.     How does personal color analysis help you improve your overall image and will it continue as a trend in Korea?        What is the personal color trend about?   The recent trend of Koreans seeking out their optimal colors has been on the rise in the past few years.      “I remember getting my own personal color through a program at a cosmetic shop,” said Kang Yi-reh, a 25-year-old in Gangseo District, western Seoul.    “From cosmetic products to clothing and accessories, I purchase everything based on my personal color.”    According to Kang, her first encounter with personal color was after she heard from a close friend that she had a personal color consulting session. Kang remembers that the friend had a different “aura.""     “I always thought, she has something special.”    After getting her personal color result, she changed every possession she owned, including cosmetic products, clothing and accessories, according to the results of her consultation.     “I think lip products had the most dramatic change and effect on me,” said Kang.    “After changing my cosmetic products and what I wear based on my personal color, I heard from so many friends that I look different.”    Kang says she feels like her entire image improved after she learned what colors were best on her.     What exactly is personal color and when was it created?             Personal color analysis categorizes people into 12 different groups and determines which palette and hue of colors looks best on them.    The 12 different groups comprise four main seasons. Depending on your physical attributes, you will either be classified as bright winter, true (cool) winter, dark winter, dark (deep) autumn, true (warm) autumn, soft (muted) autumn, soft (muted) summer, true (cool) summer, light summer, light spring, true (warm) spring or bright spring.      Winter and summer are considered cool tones, or undertones, while spring and autumn are warm tones.      Soft summer goes well with greyish and blueish colors that do not have any yellow undertones, such as dry rose.    In Korea, the first stage of most color consultations is determining whether you are a cool or a warm tone. If you suit warm colors such as orange and red, you are probably a warm tone and vice versa.    While its popularity has surged only in recent times, this beauty tool has a relatively long history.    ""Personal color became important in the beauty industry between the 1950s to the 1960s in the United States and in the 1990s in Korea,"" says Han Ji-su a beauty industry professor at Sungshin Women’s University.    “Personal color analysis looks like it suddenly emerged in recent years, but its origin comes from the four season color theory by Swiss color and art theorist Johan Itten, who has classified color palates with the four seasons,” said professor Han.    “The idea became more popular in the 1980s when a book titled ‘Color Me Beautiful’ was published based on Itten’s theory.”    Johannes Itten (1888-1967) was the first to split colors into warm and cool, and then divided them again into light and dark.     How can you find your personal color?   Personal color is determined primarily based on a person’s skin tone, eye color and hair color. For a more accurate and objective judgment, people find personal color consultants to meet with.    “I knew I was a cool tone, but I had some doubts until I had a personal color consulting session,” said Kim Hye-min, a 27-year-old office worker in Gangnam District, southern Seoul.    “I was quite relieved to hear that I suit cool colors and that I was using the right makeup products. From then on, I always try to find fashion items that are in the color suggestions I received.”      A man finds his personal color with a consultant at a job fair held in Yongin, Gyeonggi, on June 15. [NEWS1]      Most personal color consultants will have a stack of different colored fabric samples as part of their tool kit. Customers will need to come to their sessions without any makeup on as the consultants will decide your tone based on your bare skin. They will hold the fabric samples close to your face, and if your face looks slightly darker, it means that color is not for you.     Consultants can even recommend the best foundation color for you according to your personal color.    The consultation sessions can range in price from 50,000 won ($37.90) to 150,000 won.      ""Personal color became a trend, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic in Korea as people started to become more interested in themselves, particularly in what they like and what suits them well,"" said Kim Min-kyoung, CEO of the KMK Color Research Institute, who is a color consultant herself.    Kim mentioned that if time or money are factors preventing you from visiting a professional consultant, there is another option.    ""For more objective results, using artificial intelligence (AI) is another way.""      The Zamface application used AI to decide on a user's personal color. [ZAMFACE]     The Zamface application uses AI to decide on a user’s personal color by virtually applying different lipstick shades.      “I use the application quite regularly to check if I am using the right product,” Kang said, stressing how she checks regularly to see if her personal color has changed.    However, unless a person’s skin tone changes dramatically, their classification of warm or cool is unlikely to change. Although factors such as the person’s profession or favorite color may be taken into account when consultants are classifying, it is also very unlikely that the seasonal classification will change depending on the consultant, says Prof. Han.      Will this trend continue?   Young people in their 20s and 30s, or the so-called MZ generation, heavily rely on personal color when it comes to making stlye decisions. “I purchase 90 percent of my accessories in silver instead of gold since I go well with cool colors,” said Choi So-young, a 27-year-old office worker in Gangnam District, southern Seoul.    “I look tacky whenever I have anything in a warm color.”    Choi, who is highly interested in cosmetics, purchases makeup products from brands that release products based on personal colors. Brands promote their products based on personal colors, such as marketing an eye shadow palette with warm tones or cool tones.    “Korean consumers, in particular, are reacting sensitively to the trend and to how others perceive them,” said Han.    “The case is different for foreign countries as they have diverse ethnicities and have valued personal taste for a long time, unlike Koreans that have the tendency to follow the latest trends.”    The related market is expected to further grow in Korea. In 2021, the personalized cosmetics market size rose to 1.1 billion dollars despite the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. The market is anticipated to expand to 4 billion dollars by 2025.      Kwak Yoon-gy finds his personal color during a consultation session shared on his YouTube. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     The trend is not only relevant for female consumers. Olympic speed skater Kwak Yoon-gy also shared his experience visiting a personal color consultant to figure out his personal color.    Kwak shared his experience finding his personal color on his YouTube channel which has over one million subscribers in March.     ""We all knew Kwak was a cool tone,"" a comment read on his video. ""I wasn't interested in personal color before, but seeing how he looks different in different tones, I should go and have a consultation as well.""    For men, the color of their hair, ties and shirts may change their overall impression, said Kim from KMK Color Research Institute. The journey of knowing your personal color is not just about knowing whether you suit cool or warm colors.     “Getting to know your personal color is another way for you to know better about yourself,” Kang said.    “It’s also about how I look to the others, but I felt a sense of gratification by getting to know about myself more, physically, at least.”  "

Starting with sales, eighteen Korean albums sold more than a million copies this year, a 64-percent rise compared to 11 million in 2021. In 2020, only six Korean albums were million-copy sellers and in 2019, only one album, BTS's ""Map of the Soul: Persona.""    This year’s top three albums were by boy bands: BTS, Stray Kids and Seventeen. Thirteen of the 18 Korean million sellers were by boy bands or male singers.    BTS’s “Proof” was No. 1 for the year, selling 3.58 million copies since its release last June, followed by Stray Kids’ “Maxident” (3.17 million copies), Seventeen’s “Face the Sun” (2.83 million), Blackpink’s “Born Pink” (2.51 million) and NCT Dream’s “Glitch Mode — The 2nd Album” (2.10 million). BTS had only one album in the top 18 — its only release this year — but the band has been the No. 1 selling Korean artist since 2016.

Girl group IVE’s “Love Dive” was the most streamed and downloaded Korean song both domestically and globally. It was followed by Blackpink’s “Pink Venom” globally and (G)I-DLE’s “Tomboy” in Korea.    BTS’s “Dynamite” and “Butter” were the No. 3 and No. 4 most-streamed Korean songs in the world and (G)I-DLE’s “Tomboy” was No. 5.    In Korea, ballads by male singers followed in the third to fifth slots: Ballad duo Melomance’s “Love, Maybe,” singer Kim Min-seok’s “Drunken Confession” and Lim Young-woong’s “Love Always Runs Away.”    Female and male K-pop groups have different target audiences, according to pop music critic Cha Woo-jin. While boy bands focus on forming a deep, although often narrow, relationship with their loyal fans, girl groups aim for a wider pool of listeners.      Girl group (G)I-DLE [CUBE ENTERTAINMENT]      Girl group aespa [SM ENTERTAINMENT]     “Since the advent of streaming services, it’s become unnecessary to buy albums to listen to music, which means that those who do do so out of loyalty,” Cha said.    “Boy bands’ fandom has been considered to be sturdier than girl groups and that’s visible in the numbers. But what’s changing is that album sales for girl groups have increased in the last two years, especially for younger bands such as (G)I-DLE and aespa, who are appealing to both fans and general listeners.”    In fact, aespa’s “Girls — The 2nd Mini Album” was the seventh largest selling Korean album in 2022 with 1.80 million copies sold worldwide. It was the first K-pop girl group album to sell over a million albums within a week of release last July, and only two years after the group's debut. IVE’s “After LIKE” was the 10th largest Korean seller, with 1.61 million albums sold since last August.    Girl groups’ success can be attributed to a change in their overall image, according to Kim Jin-woo, a senior researcher at Circle Chart.    Girl groups in the 2010s — such as Girl’s Day, Sistar, AOA, Nine Muses, After School — went for a feminine, sexy concept that mainly appealed to male audiences. Newer bands, typically referred to as the fourth generation, go for the so-called “girl crush” vibe attractive to female fans.    “With the expansion of girl groups’ fandoms, they are likely to change their target from general listeners to fandom-centered businesses,” Kim said. “Business-wise, the K-pop market may even be changed where it becomes meaningless to distinguish between boy bands and girl groups.""

[Feature] Making big waves: How K-pop swelled into cultural superpower,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000241408?sid=104,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 15:59:00 +0900","Using K-pop as soft power instrument, South Korea has managed to grow influences in various sectors with idolsK-pop group BTS pose during 76th United Nations General Assembly held in New York on Sept. 20, 2021 (Big Hit Music)The Washington Post called it a “cultural force” -- from welcoming the US presidential couple to representing the country at the Olympic Games -- K-pop has become pervasive now beyond the realm of the entertainment industry.K-pop idol groups have communicated with the world through song, and their milestones at both local and international levels indicate Korea might have found a new resource for diplomacy.In a recent exclusive interview with The Rolling Stone, RM of BTS opened up about becoming a social figure and taking part in international events.“A K-pop group spoke at the UN and met presidents. I think I was really confused about ‘who am I.’ Am I a diplomat, or what?” he questioned.Although RM said he felt dubious about his role, it’s no secret that K-pop is not a one-off act. At the heart of the growing Hallyu fever, or Korean Wave, Korean pop music isn’t just a musical genre. It has become part of South Korea’s statecraft in recent years, with its horizon swelling to cultural and public diplomacy.The former Moon Jae-in administration’s appointment of BTS as a special presidential envoy last year was a watershed moment. Unlike the traditional formula that envoys can only be accredited to those who rank between ambassadors and high-ranked officials, Moon gave BTS the political power to deliver Korea’s messages to the international community.BTS embraced their new diplomatic role by attending the 76th United Nations General Assembly as South Korea’s official delegation. The group performed “Permission to Dance” and delivered speeches on behalf of youth and future generations.“K-pop has garnered many people’s interest in learning the language and visiting the country. It may help at first, but it’s the Korean people, culture, society and foremost the government’s responsibility to bring that interest to the next step,” said Lee Hye-jin, a communications professor at the University of Southern California.Piggybacking on the growing interest in South Korea, a Modern Language Association report showed that the Korean language uptake in US universities rose by 14 percent between 2013 and 2016. The surge in data also showed that the language-learning desire is a crucial part of a globalized fan base with wanting to connect to K-pop idols on a deeper level.According to the survey on National Image 2021 commissioned by the Korean Culture and Information Service, 80.5 percent of foreigners had a positive image of Korea in 2021, showing a 2.4 percent increase compared to 2020. The respondents justified their answers by identifying Korea’s culture, like K-pop, as a “salient” force behind their positive image of the country.Exo and CL of the now-disbanded 2NE1 highlighted South Korea’s aesthetics at the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Games closing ceremony, where the two singers performed songs based on ideas of inclusion and harmony. Kai of Exo performed solo while donning a flowing hanbok, traditional Korean attire.K-pop group Exo poses with Harry Harris, former US ambassador to South Korea, and Ivanka Trump, former White House adviser, during a cocktail reception at the Blue House in 2019. (Screenshot captured from Twitter)In 2019, Exo greeted then-US President Donald Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner during a cocktail reception before a dinner banquet at the Blue House.The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism launched a “K-Culture” initiative in 2020 aiming to diversify Korean content and boost the different cultural industries, including K-pop.K-pop kept on making big waves. Since diplomacy develops based on bilateral relations, K-pop representatives reached out to foreign audiences, countries, intergovernmental and international organizations.In July, the seven bandmates of BTS were officially named as public relations ambassadors for the 2030 Busan World Expo bid and held a free concert in the port city to support the bid. BTS also helped South Korea bid for the AFC Asian Cup 2023 in a video highlighting why the country could be a great host for the event, although the nation failed to win the bid.Now, K-pop’s influence is not only about topping Billboard charts but attracting more players to the table.South Korean conglomerate giants are teaming up with idols to jump on this bandwagon in an effort to continue to raise the Korea’s international profile.This file image shows a special collaboration between BTS and South Korean cosmetic company Amore Pacific. (Amore Pacific)For example, cosmetic giants are using K-pop idols to help position K-beauty as a brand name in the global beauty industry, which was long monopolized by European and US companies.Amore Pacific partnered with BTS for a special limited edition set featuring three scents inspired by the group’s mega-hits. Sulhwasoo, a premium brand under the beauty giant, recently named Rose of Blackpink its global ambassador.“Since Amore Pacific is a company that represents K-beauty and BTS is an artist that represents K-pop, it could be seen as a collaboration between a singer and company that represent the country,” an official at Amore Pacific told The Korea Herald.“Rose is young, but she has worked hard to become a singer, and Sulwhasoo aims to go global, so her image was compatible in terms of that, apart from the fact that Blackpink is a famed K-pop idol,” the official added.According to Korea International Trade Association, 70 percent of foreign buyers think Korea’s global reputation has positively influenced purchase decisions.This file image shows a special collaboration between BTS and South Korean cosmetic company Amore Pacific. (Amore Pacific)Not only is K-pop a tool behind the country’s national branding, but it can also be an olive branch.When Korea-China relations hit rock bottom regarding the deployment of THAAD, an advanced US missile defense system, Exo accompanied then-President Moon to the opening ceremony of the Korea-China Economic and Trade Partnership in 2017. During the event, Moon expressed hopes to make South Korea and China “true friends” by expanding cultural exchanges.In 2018, Red Velvet and Girls’ Generation Seo-hyun flocked to Pyongyang – an event nobody might’ve imagined in this century -- to perform in front of high-profile North Korean audiences, among which was North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.“Each country has its preferences in terms of which K-pop idols they favor, so national marketing has become crucial depending on which leader the country is meeting and what kind of event or business will take place,” said Lee of the University of Southern California.Lee added that, for example, if Japan-Korea ties need to thaw, BoA, one of the first Korean artists to foray into the Japanese music market successfully, could be a good diplomatic resource for the government.But Lee expressed worry only a handful of K-pop idols can fulfill their jobs as public diplomats.“Blackpink’s Lisa comes from Thailand, and so if the group goes to represent Korea, it could potentially be a strange situation with Thailand people and government. Since K-pop is becoming multinational, with an increase in foreign members, this mix could pose a dilemma for the Korean government regarding which K-pop groups to use.”"

"With little dialogue, Park Ji-hoon's latest role presented new challenge...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000031660?sid=106,"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 14:56:00 +0900","   Park Ji-hoon [WAVVE]     The beloved K-pop star who shines on stage returns to the small screen as a lonely outsider in Wavve’s original drama series “Weak Hero Class 1.”    When offered the role of the protagonist Yeon Si-eun in “Weak Hero Class 1,” singer and actor Park Ji-hoon knew it was a perfect opportunity to show a new side of himself to his fans. Park, who has been active as an actor since the age of seven, has already made a name for himself by ranking No. 2 on Mnet’s hit K-pop survival show in Season 2 of “Produce 101” (2017). Following the success of the show, he immediately debuted as one of the 11 members of the project boy band Wanna One, which became one of the most beloved, iconic third-generation boy band, storming the music charts with a series of hits such as “Energetic” (2017), “Burn It Up” (2017) and “Boomerang” (2018).    However, his winking and smiling days were gone for “Weak Hero Class 1.” Si-eun, who, on the outside, seems like an ordinary high school student, makes it clear from the very beginning of Episode 1 that he chooses to be an outsider because he has no interest in anything else other than studying. With his ultimate goal to graduate with high honors and to get into a top university to earn the attention and love of his separated parents, Si-eun is willing to destroy anything that gets in his way.       A scene from Season 2 of Mnet’s hit K-pop survival show “Produce 101"" (2017)  where Park Ji-hoon debuted as a member of project boy band Wanna One. [MNET]     Since the series was released on Wavve last week, the streaming platform reported that it ranked No. 1 in terms of influx of paid subscribers out of all content released this year, while it ranks No. 2 on OTT (over-the-top) chart Kinolights, a content recommender site based in Korea, just after JTBC’s “Reborn Rich” (2022) starring global star Song Joong-ki. The series is being simultaneously streamed on Amazon Prime, Comcast, Google TV, Roku and iQIYI, garnering positive responses from overseas. On Chinese review site Douban, the series received a score of 8.4 out of 10 from 1,787 viewers in three days after its release, while American film review site IMDb gives it 8.8 out of 10.    Park described the series as his “turning point” at a press interview at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul, on Tuesday. However, the actor did not necessarily want to totally break away from his previous image.     “I don’t want to shed the lovable, cute image that I had,” Park said. “It’s an element that I’ve wanted to possess, and I think of it as [one of] my attributes. But I did want to show a new side of myself, which is why I spent countless hours discussing the role and the series with director Yoo Soo-min. I did have a premonition that it will become a crucial turning point in my life, and I’m grateful that people realize the amount of effort I put into this role.”       Park portrayed Yeon Si-eun, an outcast from his class in high school who bonds with two of his classmates after becoming involved in violence, drugs and gambling. [WAVVE]     Adapted from Naver Webtoon “Weak Hero,” the series follows Si-eun, an outcast in his class, who becomes involved in school violence, drugs and gambling and through these things, forges a friendship with two of his classmates, Su-ho and Bum-seok, portrayed by Choi Hyun-wook and Hong Kyeong. Described as “weak in physique,” Si-eun seems to be a perfect target for school bullies — but he is extremely fast and quick in judgement, using the tools near him with full intent to catch the bullies off guard.    Although he gradually opens up to his two friends, the character stays sullen by his nature, speaking only a few sentences in each episode.    “One of the hardest parts to relate to was that Si-eun doesn’t speak that much,” Park said, adding that he had to portray his characters’ emotions mostly through his gaze and facial expressions. “But where I do feel that I’m similar to him is his loneliness. When I was in the band, I had 10 friends that I could depend on. However, since we were a project group, there was a due date [for our disbandment] and the reality of being alone hit me as I went solo [...] But I’m fine now. Three years have passed [since disbandment] and I’m in a place now where I’m okay even though I’m alone.”       Park Ji-hoon [WAVVE]     The 23-year-old actor is well-aware of his selling point, which he attempted to maximize through this series.    “It’s more difficult [to act] when it’s without any dialogue,” Park said. “So I thought what was most important was that I had to portray my emotions through my gaze, which I believe is one of the attributes that I possess.”    Park admits that Si-eun was the most intense character he has portrayed in his 16-year career. Although he may seem distant, the friendships he forges seem to be permanent for the once-lonely outsider who goes above and beyond to protect his friends, even at the cost of his grades.    “As I monitored myself through the screen, I kept crying,” he said. “I especially like my distorted face in the last episode. Both the the physical and emotional energy that I vented for the character were maximized from head to toe. After filming, I would immediately go home and zonk out to sleep.    “But I do understand why Si-eun went out of bounds to avenge for his friend, Su-ho,” he said. “Su-ho is the first friend that Si-eun ever had and his guilt that everything had happened because of him pushed him to do what he did. I believe that even though he may not seem like it, Si-eun always craved for a touch of human warmth, to have friends and be loved by his parents.”       Park Ji-hoon [WAVVE]     Park, who seems to be on the path for success as he juggles both his singing and acting careers, says his role model for the latter is Lee Byung-hun.    “One of the best compliments that I saw from the comments was that they saw me not as Park Ji-hoon, but as the character himself,” Park said. “I’m ever so grateful for that comment. It’s the same with my role model. When you see Lee Byung-hun on the screen, you see him not as the actor, but as if he’s really become that character.”    Global viewers and his fans are already crying out for for a second season of “Weak Hero Class 1,"" which the actor is positive about.       Park, on far right, as Si-eun with two of his friends Su-ho and Bum-seok, portrayed by Choi Hyun-wook and Hong Kyeong. [WAVVE]     “However, everything is undecided for now, so I’m cautious to say for sure,” he said. “But I am feeling how popular the series is. The day before yesterday, I was holding a fan meet-and-greet in Thailand, and many of my fans there complimented me on ‘Weak Hero Class 1,’ all telling me how much they enjoyed the series.    “I had anticipated [that the series would do well] but it has exceeded well beyond my expectations,” Park said. “I’ve always done my best at the given task laid out in front of me, and my fans know that I work hard even when I’m off-the-grid, so for that, I’m ever so grateful.”   "
[Eye Interview] Korean American director on why he followed five US poli...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000241287?sid=104,"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 18:17:00 +0900","""Chosen"" director Joseph Juhn (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)On Thursday morning, Korean news outlets reported that New Jersey Rep. Andy Kim had just become the second Korean American to win a third term in the US House of Representatives.Along with Kim, US Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland, who is of Korean descent, won her reelection bid as the representative of Washington state's 10th District in the US midterm elections.""Chosen"" director Joseph Juhn (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)Korean American politicians Young Kim and Michelle Steel, both of California, were in the lead and likely to secure their seats again in the US House, as of Thursday afternoon.Prospects, however, did not look so bright for David Kim, who was hoping to unseat an incumbent representative in California.While not quite sweeping, the election results clearly show how Korean American representation in US politics is changing.If you are wondering why this representation matters, the answer can perhaps be found in Korean American director Joseph Juhn’s new documentary “Chosen,” which followed the five aforementioned politicians back in 2020.The documentary skips any unnecessary introduction and gets straight to the point with a clip of an old Korean man yelling about the importance of the 1992 LA riots in Korean American history.The riots were sparked by a sense of social outrage and injustice after the acquittal of four police officers charged with excessive force in the arrest and beating of Rodney King, a Black man, that was caught on video. While chaos reigned across Los Angeles, tensions between Korean Americans and African Americans at the time led to a disproportionate outbreak of violence, looting and arson in Koreatown. To make matters worse, police and politicians largely turned a blind eye to the shop owners whose lives and property were in danger.“He was yelling and dropping F-bombs to a group of college students and he was just emphasizing over and over how important learning about the LA riots is in understanding and defining our Korean American identity,” said director Juhn, recalling the moment he documented during an interview with The Korea Herald on Oct. 28.The director, 38, who was going through an identity crisis as a Korean American university student at the time, said the old man’s passionate speech moved him greatly.“I wanted to start the film with that clip because that's the very moment where my life was changed,” he said.""Chosen"" director Joseph Juhn (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)After that day, he began to see the LA riots as a critical event that split the history of Korean American society into two -- before and after the riots.Not only was the riot a turning point in which ethnic Koreans living in the US started to identify themselves as Korean Americans -- rather than Korean immigrants -- it also made Korean Americans feel the need to realize political power for the first time, Juhn added.Juhn was also inspired to create “Chosen” by a book and an article he read in 2020.In “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir” by former US national security adviser John Bolton, the Korean American director took note of a section about US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s Hanoi summit.“The nuance of it suggested that the peace on the Korean Peninsula has been disrupted by Trump, Bolton himself and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s impulsive decisions,” he said.After reading about the influence that a few American politicians' decisions can have on Korea, the director could not stop thinking that things could have been different if there were Korean American politicians present at the summit.Around that time, he also came across an article that said five candidates of Korean descent were running for office that year in the lower house of the US Congress.“I thought, ‘Can they be the solution?’ That is how the movie began,” he said.When showing the election journey of the five candidates of Korean descent, Juhn said he took extra care to be fair.“Although the film’s story mainly revolves around David Kim, I did not want it to become a film that supports a certain party or that promotes or supports a certain candidate,” Juhn said. “I tried not to be biased as much as possible.”The director emphasized that he worked hard to make sure that all the candidates’ individual stories were told while also showing their ideological differences so that they are not lumped into one single category as candidates of Korean descent.He added that David Kim has the most running time in the film with his stories being told in greater detail because he hoped to expose many problems that Korean American society has as a whole in the movie.“I wanted to genuinely look into various existing conflicts within our Korean American society,” he said. “I often get feedback that it touches some very uncomfortable topic that is not expected.”Through David Kim’s case as a recently out gay man, Juhn said he was able to effectively touch on diverse issues of Korean American society, including generational conflict between first-generation Korean Americans who hold conservative views and the more progressive younger generation, and their intensely conflicting views on LGBTQ+ issues.The fact that David Kim was an underdog who did not get much spotlight or coverage in the mainstream media also was an aspect that interested the director.David Kim was the only candidate who failed to win his election, while the other four were successfully sworn into the 117th Congress.“I did not expect David to lose by such a small margin. Our staff also thought that they might be working so hard for nothing. The environment was not great and it was all done by volunteers,” the director said, sharing his experience watching Kim’s election campaign. “It was really surprising.”Also sharing some of the memorable responses from the audience at the Jeonju International Film Festival earlier this year, the director talked about how the film can be relevant and informative to the Korean audience.“They said they got to know Korean Americans' lives better. Some said they only had the image of Korean Americans living a better and more privileged life in the US. But they found out through this film that immigrants suffered as a minority and also had to experience LA riots and Asian hate crimes.""Juhn added many of the responses noted a similarity between the political environment in the US and Korea’s current political situation: A deep division along ideological lines with one side with conservative views and the other with progressive views.“The topics that are featured in the film including generational conflict, ideological conflict, LGBTQ+ and cultural diversity issues all are relevant to ongoing problems in Korea,” he said.Juhn added that by taking a look at how Korean Americans deal with these conflicts, Koreans can learn from them as if they were looking at a mirror.Toward the end of the interview, Juhn delved into why he thinks stories about Korean American immigrant families such as “Pachinko” and “Minari” are getting so much attention globally.“I think the diaspora narrative is universal,” he said. “A diaspora is a population that lives outside of their motherland as minorities.”The director stressed that he believes that narratives of those who lived in these special circumstances have a universal power to appeal to audiences.Juhn, too, felt that power when he accidentally met a third-generation Korean Cuban taxi driver during his vacation. He was an ordinary lawyer at the time.""I followed his family for three years and created a documentary 'Jeronimo' (2019). It is my first film. That is how I became a director,"" he said. ""At first I wanted to make a short YouTube video that can introduce this family and it grew from there.""His first film was seen by over 20,000 people in Korea when it opened in theaters and selected by 17 film festivals around the world.Those powerful diaspora stories should not be classified as just more Korean content or “gukppong” -- a usually derogatory Korean term to describe nationalistic works -- simply because they are related to Korea, Juhn added.“If possible, I want to create a movie about Joseonjok (ethnic Korean Chinese) in the future because they are being discriminated against in Korea. I think it is unfair so I want to tell their story. I also hope to tell stories about North Koreans and also Zainichi (ethnic Koreans in Japan) people like those who appeared on ‘Pachinko.’ There are so many stories that I want to cover,” he said.“Chosen” is now in local theaters."

(Millie’s Library)What’s special about audio dramas?The new breed of audio drama series currently trending is different from audiobooks or audio dramas of the past. The focus is on the word “drama,” according to Kwon Boh-youn, a professor at the graduate school of digital image and contents at Dongguk University. “The focus on drama leads to more acting with an emphasis on delivering the emotional elements,” Kwon told The Korea Herald on Nov. 7.In a similar vein, director Kwak of “Far East” explained that he and the actors had put a lot of effort into every line to deliver details such as breathing, trembling and tension in the voice.“When we recorded, we acted out each scene as if the microphone were a camera. In the shooting scenes, we ran, lied down, rolled on the floor and held guns,” said actor Kim of “Far East” during an online press conference on Sept. 1.Generally, an audio drama series consists of 10 episodes, each episode running between 10 to 14 minutes, and features multiple voice actors playing different characters. Appropriate sound effects and music are added to achieve layers of audio effects that fill the visual void.Experts say sounds with no visuals offer listeners more room for imagination.“It is somewhat paradoxical. When you watch something, you can only see what is shown on the screen. It’s instantaneous. But when you listen, the viewers’ vivid imagination is sparked based on their previous experiences,” said Jung Duk-hyun, a pop culture critic.“Even in a regular film, what makes a spaceship feel like it is passing by is the swooshing sound that moves from the back to the front of the theater,” he added.To create an immersive sound experience, Naver’s Vibe uses Dolby Atmos, a spatial audio technology which allows the listeners to feel where a bullet is coming from or how fast a car is going, said a Naver official. It is the same technology that is also used in films and cinemas.Another selling point of audio dramas and audio films is that multitasking is possible while listening -- something that appeals to the younger generation.“Many of the reviewers said that they listened to the drama while commuting or exercising,” said Kim Min-kyung, a new content project manager at Millie’s Library. Kim oversaw two audio drama projects including “Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop.”“The fact that you can listen to the drama while doing something else seems to meet the demands of young people who are used to multitasking,” Kim said.Poster for drama “A Business Proposal” (left) and its webtoon version (Kakao Entertainment)Fandom-based IPsAlthough original audio content is released from time to time, adaptations of popular web novels and webtoons make up the bulk of audio dramas that are available now.Audio Clip, Naver’s audio content platform launched in 2017, and Kakao Page have been producing audio drama series featuring professional voice actors, investing in original web content and expanding their IPs.Adaptations such as “The Remarried Empress” (2021) from Audio Clip and “Business Proposal” (2022) from Kakao Page still hold top spots in terms of subscriber numbers and number of plays.“It’s natural for the companies to tap into the audio market. They need to grab consumers with different appeals, so a one source multi-use strategy is necessary,” said Kwon of Dongguk University.However, while this strategy appeals to the existing fans, newcomers (to the audio market) may find it difficult to follow the storyline without any background knowledge, Kwon pointed out.“A market needs an influx of new users to expand. … Audio content needs a new storytelling strategy of narratives that take into account users who are unfamiliar with the original storyline,” explained Kwon. Such strategy would involve writing and producing that are specifically geared toward the audio drama form.Poster for the audio drama “The Remarried Empress” (Audio Clip)On a positive note, companies and critics predict continued growth of the audio content market.The size of the domestic audio content market including audiobooks is estimated at 25.6 billion won ($18.6 million) in 2019 and is expected to grow to 111 billion won in 2024, according to Statista, a German-based market and consumer data company. The size of the global audio content market is also expected to reach $75.3 billion in 2030, according to Goldman Sachs.Outside Korea, audio dramas have been thriving in the past decade on Apple and Google as part of their podcast offerings as well as on audio platforms such as Spotify and BBC radio channels.“One strength of audio technology is that it can respond flexibly to future platforms such as wearable devices, connected cars, and artificial intelligence. Audio content is easy to integrate with other technologies,” said Lee Yung-hee, a culture critic.For example, eight out of 19 voices from “Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop” are created with artificial intelligence, according to Millie’s Library.Lee also said audio content has the power to appeal to people of all ages, not just 20- or 30-somethings.“Right now, young adults are the main target for audio drama and movies, but that does not mean the older generation doesn’t listen to audio content. With the right genre and right narratives, an audio drama has a lot of power to speak to a much wider audience,” Lee said."

Samsung Electronics Announces First Quarter 2021 Results,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/138/0002102523?sid=105,"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 12:15:00 +0900","- Quarterly operating profit at KRW 9.38 trillion on sales of KRW 65.39 trillion   By Yun Sang-ho   crow@ddaily.co.kr   [Digital Daily]   Seoul, Korea, April 29, 2021- Samsung Electronics today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021.  Total consolidated revenue was KRW 65.39 trillion, a 6% increase from the previous quarter and a record for the first quarter.   Operating profit increased 4% from the previous three-month period to KRW 9.38 trillion as solid sales of smartphones and consumer electronics outweighed lower earnings from semiconductors and displays.   The semiconductor business saw an earnings decline quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) despite solid memory shipments, mainly due to the production disruption at the Austin fab, and a downward trend in NAND prices, while initial costs of new line ramp-up associated with advanced node migration also weighed on the results. Profit from the Display Panel Business fell quarter-on-quarter because of weak seasonality of mobile products.   Earnings at the Mobile Communications Business rose significantly as sales of flagship and mass-market smartphones increased and contributions of products in the Device Ecosystem such as tablets, PCs and wearables grew. The Networks Business maintained solid performance on the back of continued expansion of 5G globally.   The Consumer Electronics Division reported higher profit both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year as demand remained strong for digital appliances and premium TVs.   In the second quarter, earnings at the semiconductor business is expected to increase as memory market conditions improve on the back of strong server demand. The Foundry Business has seen a full resumption of production at the Austin fab, while the System LSI Business is expected to continue to be impacted from the previous quarter’s foundry disruption. For displays, mobile panel sales is likely to decline due to weak seasonality for mobile phones and the effects of some component shortages.   The Mobile Communications Business is set to see revenue and profit decrease as flagship smartphone sales fall and some components experience supply issues. The Company plans to minimize the impact from components by leveraging its global supply chain management (SCM) capabilities. The Consumer Electronics Division will focus on bolstering sales of new products such as Neo QLED models and expanding sales of the Bespoke lineup.   For the second half, market conditions is expected to improve for the component business with the Company continuing to extend product and technology leadership. In smartphones and consumer electronics, the Company will focus on strengthening the premium category leadership. However, global macroeconomic risks, including uncertainties over demand related to COVID-19, are likely to persist.   The Memory Business is expected to see solid demand for server and mobile products and the Company will accelerate migration to 15-nano DRAM and 128-layer 6th-generation V-NAND as well as expand application of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography processes. The System LSI Business will maximize supply capabilities by cooperating with foundries at home and abroad, while the Foundry Business will expand supply with mass production at the Pyeongtaek Line 2.   The Display Panel Business will continue to increase adoption of OLED panels and establish a foundation for quantum-dot (QD) displays in large-sized panels.   The Mobile Communications Business plans to post solid profitability by popularizing foldable models, expanding the lineup of mass-market 5G phones and increasing sales of tablets, PCs and wearables. The Networks Business will continue to address demand from growing 5G commercialization globally while the Consumer Electronics Division will seek to secure profitability by expanding sales of premium products.   The Company’s capital expenditures in the first quarter stood at KRW 9.7 trillion, including KRW 8.5 trillion spent on semiconductors and KRW 0.7 trillion on displays.   The semiconductor business posted KRW 19.01 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.37 trillion in operating profit in the first quarter.   The Memory Business saw a slight profit decline due to a downward trend in NAND prices and initial costs associated with ramping up new lines, despite overall decent demand backed by server and mobile products.   For DRAM, demand for mobile stayed solid despite the weak seasonality due to releases of new models by major customers and increased penetration of 5G smartphones. Demand from PC remained strong as online-based activities became routine for global consumers.    Server demand increased significantly year-on-year, as content-per-box rose due to increasing adoption of a new server CPU and as demand was solid mainly from datacenters. Demand for consumer products was also strong, due to an increase in 4K high-definition content and growth in TV and set-top box memory content to use streaming services.   As for NAND, demand from mobile was robust supported by strong smartphone sales along with rising demand and content-per-box. Server SSD saw growth in demand compared to the previous quarter thanks to the base effect of weak demand in the previous quarter as major datacenter companies resumed storage investments.   Looking to the second quarter, the Company expects to improve earnings significantly amid favorable business conditions, which include strong demand across all applications.   DRAM demand is likely to stay robust thanks to the expanding 5G market and related growth in content-per-box and sever demand will continue to be strong backed by solid demand for cloud applications. PC demand will stay solid as educational laptops enter peak seasonality.   For NAND, demand is expected to pick up because of growing content-per-box from expanding 5G line-ups at major customers. Demand for Server SSD is likely to stay strong due to increased storage demand from customers and a high capacity trend with the release of a new CPU. The Company will actively address the increase in demand for high-capacity SSD with 8TB or more, while accelerating migration to the industry’s only single-stack based 128-layer 6th generation 512Gb V-NAND to strengthen technological leadership and cost competiveness.   For the second half, amid the accelerating economic recovery from persisting stimulus programs in numerous countries, demand for servers and storage will keep growing because of expanding investment in datacenters and the high capacity trend with the release of a new CPU. Mobile demand will keep rising with the launch of new models from major customers and the broad penetration of 5G and PC demand will remain strong backed by continuing demand for upgrades and additional units in households.    Based on strong, across-the-board demand, DRAM prices are expected to continue the upward trend through the second half of the year. For NAND in the second half, demand for certain applications is expected to exceed supply due to a controller supply-demand imbalance for solution products.   In addition, 15-nm DRAM and 128-layer 6th Generation V-NAND will drive bit growth and cost competitiveness in the second half, and the Company will continue to strengthen technology competitiveness by applying EUV on multiple layers of the 14-nm DRAM based on industry leading technology and through the ramping-up production of solution products adopting double-stack based 176-layer 7th generation V-NAND in the second half.   The System LSI Business increased supply of mobile SoCs and image sensors in the first quarter backed by launches of flagship and high-end smartphones, but earnings remained mostly flat QoQ due to impacts of mobile DDI supply issues caused by foundry production disruption. However, the Company reinforced technological leadership by releasing the Exynos 2100, its first premium 5G-integrated mobile processor, as well as a 50-megapixel ISOCELL image sensor with advanced Dual Pixel Pro.   In the second quarter, demand for mobile components is expected to weaken due to a seasonal decline in smartphone demand and continuing effects of the disruption of foundry production in the previous quarter. As for the second half, amid the possibility that the current supply shortages will persist, the Company will maximize its capability to supply chips by strengthening cooperation with the in-house foundry and expanding use of outsourced foundries.   The Foundry Business saw its earnings decline in the first quarter due to a disruption of production at the Austin fab in the U.S. from a major power outage. However, the Company continued its efforts to strengthen its technological leadership by starting the development of the 2nd generation 3-nm process and completing the development of the 14-nm and 8-nm RF processes to lead the 5G market.   The production line in Austin has been fully normalized in the second quarter. The Company will prepare to expand supply in the second half of the year through the start of mass production at the Pyeongtaek Line 2 and continue to lead technological leadership by reinforcing its differentiated package solutions. In the second half, growth in the foundry market is expected to exceed previous projections due to acceleration of 5G penetration, a resumption of corporate IT investments, and growing demand from customers securing safety stock. The Company will respond to increasing customer demand through active supply expansions via full operation of the Pyeongtaek Line 2, and will expand its global customer bases and diversify applications.   The Display Panel Business posted KRW 6.92 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.36 trillion in operating profit for the first quarter.    Mobile display earnings declined QoQ because of chip shortages affecting major smartphone customers and weak seasonality. However, earnings improved year-on-year (YoY) as the expanded adoption of OLED displays from flagship to entry-level models drove growth. Large displays saw a drop in earnings due to ongoing conversion of manufacturing lines in preparation for the next generation TVs.    Looking ahead to the second quarter, Samsung expects weak demand for mobile displays compared to the previous quarter because of the seasonal impact and as consumers hold off buying new smartphone models until later in the year. The Company aims to raise utilization rate and secure profitability by advancing the production. For large displays, it will continue to smooth the way for the transition to new business model based on QD display technology.   In the second half, the smartphone market is forecast to continue its recovery thanks to growing demand for 5G smartphones. The Company will strive to have panel components secured and technology development completed in time to deliver panels in a stable manner for major customers.   In particular, demand for foldable phones and other IT devices is expected to continue to grow in the post-pandemic era. The Company will focus on addressing such demand and exploring new applications such as automotive to strengthen its leadership in the OLED market. For large displays, Samsung will channel all its efforts towards preparing for the mass production of QD displays, the next generation panel technology.    The IT & Mobile Communications Division posted KRW 29.21 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 4.39 trillion in operating profit for the first quarter.    While market demand decreased QoQ amid weak seasonality, the Company saw overall demand recovering from a year earlier when the market was significantly impacted by COVID-19. The Mobile Communications Business saw material growth in both revenue and profits from the previous quarter. Flagship smartphone sales increased QoQ underpinned by the launch of Galaxy S21, as well as mass-market models such as Galaxy A-Series maintaining solid sales performance. Device Ecosystem products including tablet, PC and wearables also contributed to the profit growth in the first quarter.    Looking ahead to the second quarter, sales of new Galaxy A products such as A72 and A52 are expected to ramp up and tablets, wearables and Galaxy Book - a newly-introduced notebook PC - are expected to remain solid. However, diminishing new product effects for the flagship model and the component supply shortages are likely to weaken revenue of the Mobile Communications Business QoQ. By rebalancing supply with its global SCM capabilities, the Company will minimize the business impact and strive to secure profitability.    For the second half, market demand is forecast to recover to the pre-COVID level on an annual basis backed by a gradual economic recovery and continued expansion of the 5G market. The Company will strive to achieve solid profits and strengthen its leadership in the premium segment by popularizing the foldable category, while also enhancing competitive mass-market 5G lineup and further growing its tablet, PC and wearable businesses.    As for the Network Business, sales in the first quarter increased QoQ with robust profitability mainly led by business growth in North America and Japan. The Company will continue with its 5G equipment expansion in Korea and network rollouts in overseas market including North America and Southwest Asia. The Company will remain active in commercializing 5G network globally while exploring new business opportunities.  Strong Earnings for TVs and Appliances as Stay-at-Home Demand Continues    The Consumer Electronics Division, comprised of the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses, recorded KRW 12.99 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.12 trillion in operating profit in the first quarter.   Demand for TVs declined QoQ following the year-end peak in the previous quarter, but increased YoY due to sustained demand in advanced markets. The Company posted both stronger sales and profit YoY as it leveraged its global SCM capabilities to swiftly respond to heightened demand. It also saw increased sales of its premium products, including strong initial sales of the new Neo QLED lineup.   In the second quarter, the Company expects TV demand to increase YoY with major sporting events including the UEFA Euro 2020 and the Summer Olympic Games expected to take place. However, risks persist around COVID-19 as new surges across the globe lead to additional lockdown measures. The Company will aim to increase profitability by focusing on sales of its Neo QLEDs, responding to strong demand for home entertainment products, and successfully launching its new Micro LED products for home.    In the second half, a switch of demand from home entertainment to outdoor activities is expected as more countries reach herd immunity, resulting in weaker demand for TVs. The Company will closely monitor market conditions and respond in a flexible manner, while continuing its focus on sales of premium and lifestyle product categories.    Demand remained strong in the first quarter for the Digital Appliances Business, despite traditionally weak seasonality. Earnings rose due to strong sales of premium products such as customizable Bespoke refrigerators, as increased time at home led to stronger interest in home appliances and interior design.    While demand is expected to stay strong in the second quarter, rising material and logistics costs are expected to pose a risk. The Company plans to respond by focusing on the expansion of its Bespoke Home platform, introducing new product categories and expanding into additional markets.    Uncertainties are expected to continue in the second half for the digital appliance market. The Company will continue to focus on the global expansion of its Bespoke lineup while further strengthening its online and B2B sales capabilities.▶ 네이버에서 디지털데일리 채널 구독하기▶ IT정보의 즐거운 업그레이드 [딜라이트닷넷]<저작권자 © 디지털데일리 무단전재-재배포금지>		"
"[WHY] Pose, smile and say ""Kimchi!"" to get on board with Korea's latest ...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000031000?sid=103,"Tue, 08 Nov 2022 15:27:00 +0900","  The Czechoslovak slapstick animated series Pat & Mat's version of Life Four Cuts poses created an ongoing trend on social media, with actors Park Hae-soo and Yoo Ji-tae mimiking the poses. The two starred in Netflix's “Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area” (2022). [SCREEN CAPTURE, NETFLIX]     “Want to go take a Life Four Cuts?”    When hanging with friends in Korea, someone in the group is bound to randomly say this phrase, and soon you will probably find yourself wearing funny wigs or sunglasses inside a photo booth.    For those wondering what “Life Four Cuts” is, simply put, it refers to booths where people can dress up to take a four-image photo strip for just 4,000 won ($2.80).    It is one of Korea’s biggest and most popular photo machine franchises, and because taking photo strips has become so common, Life Four Cuts has become the generic name, similar to Band-Aid and Post-it.    The franchise started out small, with a single unmanned booth on the streets of Daegu in 2017. Since then, however, Life Four Cuts has seen immense success, branching out all across Korea. As of October 2022 it has almost 400 stores nationwide.      A Life Four Cuts store in Eunpyeong District, northern Seoul [LIFE FOUR CUTS]     The brand revealed last year that it also launched booths overseas in the United States, Canada, Guatemala, the Philippines, Vietnam, New Zealand and Japan.    While Life Four Cuts was arguably the first to kickstart the popularity of photo booths, there are now dozens of other brands, like Photoism, Selpix and Haru Film, scattered all over the nation.    Why are these photo booths so popular?      Comedian Park Na-rae and short track speed skating Olympian Kwak Yoon-gy, with the pink hair, pose for an edit of the popular photo strips. [SCREEN CAPTURE]        More than meets the eye   While these photo strips may look simple, it is the experience of creating them that attracts the younger generation.    It can be likened to a number of activities that have gained popularity in recent years, like wearing uniforms to amusement parks or wearing hanbok (Korean traditional dress) when touring Gyeongbok Palace, both of which are based in the desire to take aesthetic pictures for Instagram.     Photo booth photography is the same.     “You can’t afford to miss out on it,” said Kim Ye-jin, a 24-year-old who lives in Ansan, Gyeonggi.    “I think the biggest advantage of these photo strips is that you don't have to spend too much time and money at a studio and are able to conveniently capture memories with your friends,” said Kim.    Because photo strips can record any moment in a convenient and cheap manner, they have become a form of entertainment, says Suh Yong-gu, a business management professor at Sookmyung Women’s University.    “We can become, say, the prince of Saudi Arabia or whatever you want, when you go inside the photo booth to take a snap,” Prof. Suh told the Korea JoongAng Daily. “It’s cheap, and even the stores are unmanned. People want to do exciting things like travel, but reality is holding them back, which is why they are turning to these opportunities to apply makeup or transform into other things like a cowboy with hats on display. This is something we call ‘instant gratification' — when you buy or do something on impulse, your dopamine level rises. Anyone would surely enjoy spending 4,000 won to curate a whole new persona.”      The inside of a Life Four Cuts store [LIFE FOUR CUTS]     Even though smartphones easily allow us to take photographs anytime, anywhere, they are unable to match the “perfect lighting and makeup filters” the photo booths provide, Prof. Suh added.    Before smartphones started taking over the camera world, there were far fewer opportunities to pose for the camera, thus the perception of taking pictures for entertainment only came about after instant photography became popular.    Until the 1990’s, getting your picture taken in Korea was perceived to be something formal and somewhat serious.    “Before [instant photography], most pictures were taken out of obligation in a solemn and stiff manner,” professional photographer Kang Hong-goo wrote in an article for weekly magazine SisaIN in 2019.    As most photos were taken in professional studios, it was expensive and time-consuming. Such shoots usually took place to celebrate big events such as birthdays, graduation ceremonies or weddings.    “People would take photos, print them and put them in albums to remember the specific event,” Kang explained, which would basically be all there is to it, as opposed to instant photography nowadays that are taken practically anytime and anyplace.        The inside of a Photoism store in Seo District, Incheon shows two photo booths and hundreds of photo strips taped onto the walls. [SHIN MIN-HEE]     The need for nostalgia        The recent surge of Y2K nostalgia is considered to be another factor in the growing popularity of photo booths.     Twenty-four-year-old Kim says that the “basic analog mood” the photo strips offer are what keep her going back to the photo booths for more. The fact that they are printable — in the standard 2- (5.08 centimeter) by 6-inch sized frame — also adds to the appeal.    “I feel like there's nothing left to reminisce on when you take pictures on your smartphones. It does a fantastic job at recording things on the spot but there's no physical output, because they are only viewable on your phone, which I sometimes find a bummer,” said Kim.    “So what would be more memorable — having unlimited access to loads of pictures on your smartphone that you forget about immediately afterward, or a limited number of printed photographs that only you and your friends share forever?”      The stars of ENA's hit television series ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo"" (2022) gave fans a Netflix version of a photo strip. [NETFLIX]     Park Yoon-seo, a 22-year-old from Suwon, Gyeonggi, makes sure to go the extra step to keep her polaroid images that she took with friends in a photo album.    Stores both online and offline sell a wide variety of albums with specific slots to fit photo strips.     Park enjoys watching YouTube videos or reading online blog posts about how to decorate her albums with stickers.    “These photo strips are also usable as interior decor. I bought wooden clothespins to hang them on the walls of my room, or even simpler: I just keep them on my desk or drawers because they look pretty even just like that,” she said.      Boy band N.Flying members gave fans a laugh on social media with their Life Four Cuts poses, and created a new trend. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Social media trendsetter        While many social media trends tend to march on forward with the metaverse or virtual reality, others are backtracking to remind people of the good old days.    Because a Life Four Cuts photo strip has space for four different pictures, social media users have been scurrying online to give each other tips for the best poses.    On Instagram, there are over 48,000 posts with the hashtag “Life Four Cuts Poses” (translated), with various suggestions according to the number of people you are planning to take snaps with.      Pororo, Korea's beloved animated penguin, shows its Life Four Cuts poses on social media along with dinosaur character Crong. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Pororo, Korea’s beloved animated penguin popular with kids, posted on its official account in early October how it would pose for a Life Four Cuts along with fellow dinosaur character Crong. Other accounts have also uploaded Sailor Moon-inspired poses or Spongebob-inspired ones, garnering thousands of likes.    “It’s hard to figure out which pose to do in just a matter of seconds before the shutter goes off,” said Park. “And when you’re with a group of friends, you want the pictures to turn out nicely and in harmony. Lately, poses like the ‘gyaru [the Japanese pronunciation for 'gal'] peace sign’ and the ‘cheek heart pose’ have been really popular.”      Boy band Seventeen's Seungkwan posted a Life Four Cuts with a frame celebrating his birthday on social media. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Social media also provides ideas for what types of frames to use on the photo strips, which people can create themselves on apps. Photo booth brands often offer special edition frames according to the season or holidays for a limited time.    Park says that one routine she strictly adheres to is taking a Boomerang video — a burst of photos that plays back and forth to create a video that continuously replays on a loop — on her phone when the booth is printing the photo strips.     “It may not be that important if you just want to be finished with the final picture, but for me, it’s like a small ritual to take a Boomerang,” Park said. “Because in the end, it’s having fun that really matters, isn’t it?”  Are photo booths here to stay?        This isn’t the first time instant photography has seen a surge in popularity in Korea — back in the 2000’s, photo stickers were all the rage. They are what the name infers — stamp-sized, adhesive pictures with beauty filters that notoriously enlarge the eyes and enhance the skin.    Originating from Japan, where they are called “purikura” — a shortened Japanese pronunciation of the words for “print club” — photo stickers were highly sought after until the early 2010’s. Now, however, it’s practically impossible to find a photo sticker store.      A scene from the JTBC television series ""More Than Friends"" (2020) shows photo stickers posted to Cyworld, a local social media platform that was popular during the 2000's [JTBC]     Purikura are still popular in Japan, but why did they dwindle away in Korea?    Some say they started to feel discomfort in the way photo stickers created an unnatural sculpted look.    “There’s this old-style mood in photo stickers that make them too artificial. They make the eyes abnormally huge or sharpen the chin way too much,” said Choi Min-seong, a 25-year-old student living in Songpa District, southern Seoul.      “Ten years ago, the trends actually favored this look, and since we didn’t have smartphones back then and it was too expensive to take pictures at a studio frequently, people opted for photo stickers. But as time passed, I think it became a bit too much — I like to see myself appear natural in a photograph, and not look like I have bulging eyes with a triangular, pointy chin.”    It was around 2017 when photo booths made a return to mainstream popularity with the brands we see today, which offer photos that boast a natural look with higher resolution.      These images also include a QR code that will lead to a mobile downloadable version and a stop motion clip of you and your friends posing for the camera.    Like any other trend, and as seen with photo stickers, there is a chance that one day, people will stop taking gathering their friends to make memories in the photo booths scattered across the country. But for now, they are continuing to pose and say, ""Kimchi!""    "
[CELEB] Lee Chae Yeon is done with auditions and ready to debut,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000029932?sid=106,"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 16:22:00 +0900","   Lee Chae Yeon poses during a press showcase to promote her solo debut EP ""Hush Rush"" at Yes24 Live Hall in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul, on Wednesday. [WM ENTERTAINMENT]     Lee Chae Yeon finally made her solo debut with the EP “Hush Rush” on Wednesday.    The former IZ*ONE member has been on the K-pop scene for some ten years, competing on numerous audition shows.    “I’m nervous about performing on stage by myself and not as a team, but I’m thrilled to show everyone a new chapter,” Lee said during a press showcase event at the Yes24 Live Hall in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul, a few hours before the EP's release.    Lee is donning a kitschy vampire concept for ""Hush Rush,"" just in time for Halloween.    “The title track is about an MZ [millennial, Generation Z] generation vampire who feels excited to meet the world after waking from a 300-year-long sleep,” Lee laughed, while adding, “I’m actually 324 years old.”       A concept image for ″Hush Rush″ [WM ENTERTAINMENT]     The concept for “Hush Rush” aims to portray a vampire not in the usual creepy and horrific way, but with a Y2K-inspired look, which is considered the latest trend for the younger generation.    Lee performed “Hush Rush,” which involved choreography that saw her make vampire fangs with her fingers.    The music video was shot in Barcelona, and it was Lee’s first time to visit Spain.    “There are scenes in the music video in which I have to be surprised to see the world since I’m the vampire, but I had no problem acting because everything — the food, language and streets — in Spain was completely new to me,” Lee said.       Lee, far left, was a member of project girl group IZ*ONE from 2018 to 2021. [SWING ENTERTAINMENT]     The EP has three more songs: “Danny,” “Aquamarine” and “Same But Different.”    Lee also performed “Danny,” a synth-pop track whose choreography was inspired by the 1980 French film “La Boum” and is about maintaining a long-distance relationship with an imaginary figure named Danny.    Lee made her official debut in 2018 as a member of project girl group IZ*ONE, but first appeared on the scene when she competed on entertainment agency Fantagio's audition show ""i-Teen"" (2012). She went on to appear on season three of SBS's ""K-pop Star"" (2013-14), Mnet's ""Sixteen"" (2015) and ""Produce 48"" (2018).       Lee competed on ""Sixteen"" (2015), a K-pop competition show by Mnet to launch JYP Entertainment's new girl group, which would subsequently become Twice. [MNET]     She became a familiar face to many because she appeared on these shows along with her younger sister, now Chaeryeong of girl group ITZY. The pair were well-known, in particular for their talent when it comes to dancing.     It was on ""Produce 48"" that Lee finally ranked No. 12, earning her a spot in IZ*ONE. IZ*ONE released multiple hits including “La Vie en Rose” (2018), “Violeta” (2019), “Fiesta” (2020), “Secret Story of the Swan” (2020) and “Panorama” (2020).

"After worker killed at factory, SPC Group faces boycott",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000030262?sid=101,"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 18:01:00 +0900","  Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions hold a banner saying they will boycott SPC Group products on Thursday. [YONHAP]       Civic groups have launched a boycott of SPC Group, operator of the country's top bakery brand, Paris Baguette, following an industrial accident at a bread factory affiliated with the group that killed a worker.     ""Boycotting SPC could be hard because the company has so many brands,"" wrote one Twitter user in a message that was retweeted over 15,000 times, ""but I think we can succeed if we just start by boycotting Paris Baguette.""     Civic group Raise Up 1114 asked people to help the boycott by posting images of food and bakery franchises affiliated with SPC Group on its website and social media channels on Wednesday, getting over 20,000 retweets as of Thursday.    The list includes Paris Baguette, Baskin Robbins and Dunkin'.    Paris Croissant — the parent of SPL that is wholly owned by SPC Group Chairman Hur Young-in and his family — runs Paris Baguette. BR Korea, 66.67 percent owned by Chairman Hur and his family, runs Baskin Robbins and Dunkin' in Korea.     Anger has been spreading online since the death of a 23-year-old employee at SPL's bread making factory in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, who died Oct. 15 after getting caught in an industrial mixer.    The company's image has been hurt by allegations that the factory put a screen around the industrial mixer that killed the worker, and other employees had to keep on working. The SPL branch of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the more radical of Korea's two labor groups, went on Twitter to upload a photo of an industrial mixer draped with a white screen and employees working in the background on Oct. 16, writing that ""the factory that the accident happened was busy today making sandwiches.""    President Yoon Suk-yeol addressed the issue Thursday.    ""People from the Ministry of Employment and Labor immediately went to the site for an investigation, and they stopped all machines without safety locks,"" Yoon told reporters on his way into work on Thursday. ""They did see some machines without safety locks running and stopped them, and I think that is why some people have been told that the machines were being operated.""     ""It was a very tragic accident,"" Yoon continued, ""and I have ordered people to look into the issue.""    YouTuber ITSub, who has 2.24 million subscribers, indirectly mentioned the boycott.   YouTuber ITSub looks at a list of brands affiliated with SPC Group. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     In a video reviewing Apple's new 10th generation iPads Tuesday, the YouTuber displayed an image of a list consisting of all franchises affiliated with SPC Group. Although ITSub didn't directly recommend a boycott of the brands, the video shows him looking at the list and saying that he can ""see them all clearly at one glance.""    A committee of Paris Baguette franchise owners expressed concern about the boycott, saying it will only hurt the small businesspersons running franchises.    ""Using violent language and encouraging boycotts without considering the damage innocent franchisees and their families will feel is no different than companies that neglect workers' rights,"" read a statement uploaded Wednesday.    Shares of SPC Samlip, the only listed company under Paris Croissant, fell 2.3 percent to 72,300 won ($50) on Thursday. Before the accident, SPC Samlip shares traded at 78,800 won per share on Oct. 14. The company lost market capitalization of 56 billion won.    Boycotts are felt hard by food and retailers, with Namyang Dairy Products one example.    In 2013, many people boycotted Namyang Dairy Products after one of its employees forced a wholesaler to buy more products than he could afford by verbally abusing him. The company's revenue in 2013 dropped 9.9 percent on year to 1.23 trillion won.   "
Political trauma of Sewol disaster haunts government response to Itaewon,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000241092?sid=104,"Thu, 03 Nov 2022 16:05:00 +0900","Halloween tragedy becomes a major challenge for Yoon government, reminiscent of political fallout from 2014 ferry sinkingCivic groups call on the president to apologize over Halloween tragedy in Itaewon and slam the police report focusing on the political impact of the event outside the War Memorial of Korea, Yongsan in Seoul on Thursday. (Yonhap)As South Korea searches for answers to why 156 people died in an Itaewon alley on Oct. 29, a sensitive question is lingering in the minds of some politicians – particularly those on the right.""Could this turn into a political debacle like Sewol?""The sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 resulted in the death of 304 people, most of them high school students. When it happened, the Park Geun-hye administration faced a massive public outcry over its slow and botched response to the disaster. Park was later impeached by parliament on multiple grounds, including for abuse of power and a failure to protect the citizens as president.For Yoon Suk-yeol, the first conservative president after Park’s fall, the Itaewon disaster comes at a difficult time. Just months into his presidency, he has already faced accusations of incompetence, with approval ratings currently hovering around 30 percent.But President Yoon’s response was swift, likely thanks to the lessons from the Sewol ferry disaster, said Professor Lee Jun-han at the Department of Political Science and International Studies at Incheon National University.“In the case of the Itaewon disaster, acknowledgements came quicker – releasing the transcripts of emergency calls or the interior minister’s flip-flop,” he said, referring to Interior Minister Lee Sang-min’s apology for saying the number of people in Itaewon was “not worryingly high in particular.”But for an unpopular president in his first year, how the government responds to the deadly crowd crush will pose a “major political challenge,” the scholar noted.Political analyst Youn Tae-gon said the Yoon government will be very cautious with its response to the tragedy after the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014.“If (the government’s cautious approach) turns out positively, it will be reaching out to the victims and the public with more sensitivity,” he said. If it is done poorly, the government might take an aggressive or a defensive approach, he added.“So far, it seemd they have been defensive in their approach,” he said.While resisting calls from opposition lawmakers to offer a public apology over what happened, Yoon has visited a funeral altar of the victims to pay his respects every day since Monday.“Incident” or “disaster”?What to call the tragic event and those who died from it has also become a political issue, with opposition lawmakers calling for the use of the words “disaster” and “victims” at memorial alters. The Ministry of the Interior and Safety explained on Wednesday that it first ordered local governments to use the words “incident” and “deceased” at memorial alters to avoid “perpetuating a negative image” of the neighborhood.On Wednesday, wording used on a banner at a memorial altar set up in Gwangju was changed from “the deceased of the Itaewon incident” to “victims of the Itaewon disaster.”Areum Jeong, a researcher who is writing a book on the aftermath of the Sewol ferry disaster, said that by choosing certain words, the government is downplaying its culpability.“By avoiding terms such as “disaster” and “victims,” the government is trying to reduce what the disaster really is and avoid responsibility. And without properly using the correct language, the people cannot mourn.""While cautious about linking the two events as the investigations are still ongoing, Jeong said there certainly is a parallel in how both disasters took place.“Like the Sewol (ferry sinking), the disaster in Itaewon was something that could have happened to anyone. The younger generation has witnessed once again that the nation will not prioritize the people’s safety,” she said.“Unless the government takes responsibility, offers sincere condolences, and prioritizes public safety to prevent future disasters, the people will continue to talk and question the systemic causes and failures that brought about the Itaewon disaster,” she added.'Wary of potential political impact'In an internal police report obtained by TV network SBS, the National Police Agency described the Itaewon tragedy as the biggest disaster since the Sewol ferry sinking. The report warned that some “progressive-leaning groups could call for the government to resign” if there are growing calls to hold the government accountable.It also highlights how politically damaging the handling of the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014 was for the previous conservative Park Geun-hye government.It also warned that women’s rights groups could use the gender ratio of the victims – 101 out of the 156 confirmed dead were women – to criticize the government’s plans to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.Kwon Soo-hyun, the head of the Korea Women’s Political Solidarity, said the report makes it seem like police are treating the incident “politically.”“With the position of the National Police Agency weakened under the Yoon administration, the report looks as though police are trying to impress the government,” she said.Earlier this year, the Interior Ministry formed a new bureau to supervise the law enforcement agency, despite backlash from police officers.Yoon’s approval ratings reached 35 percent for the first time in four weeks in the latest Realmeter poll, which was conducted before the Itaewon crowd crush on Saturday."

""There is no internal discussion (about a cut in memory chip production) at the moment,"" Han Jin-man, executive vice president and head of the memory global sales and marketing at Samsung Electronics, said at the annual Samsung Tech Day on Wednesday (U.S. time), currently taking place in San Jose, California.   ""Samsung's basic position on this matter is that there should not be artificial production cuts,"" he said, while stressing that Samsung ""is trying to make sure there is neither a chronic shortage nor oversupply of chips in the market.""Samsung Electronics executives attend a media briefing of Samsung Tech Day 2022 in San Jose, California, on Oct. 5, 2022. (Yonhap)His comments came as U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology said it would cut capital spending by up to 30 percent and chip equipment spending up to 50 percent to slow supply growth in fiscal year 2023.   It is ""prudent"" to ""bring our supply in line with demand"" in the current ""unprecedented"" environment that has impacted demand and caused ""the unprecedented level of inventory adjustments by our customers,"" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said during the company's earnings call late last month.   Micron posted weak earnings for its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, with sales decreasing 19.7 percent on-year on weak consumer demand amid high inflation in major economies.    Micron is the world's third-largest DRAM maker with a 24.8 percent market share, trailing behind industry leader Samsung with 42.7 percent and runner-up SK hynix Inc. with 27.1 percent, according to global market researcher Omdia.   The U.S chipmaker's performance is closely watched as an early indicator of the chip market's strength ahead of earnings results from Samsung and SK hynix, which will announce their third-quarter results late this month.   On the U.S.-led ""Chip 4"" initiative with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, aimed at strengthening Washington's access to semiconductors and weakening that of China, Han refrained from going into the sensitive issue.   ""It is an inter-governmental issue,"" he said, adding that Samsung ""is closely watching any development.""     At the event, which returned fully in-person for the first time in three years due to the pandemic, Samsung showcased its next-generation memory solutions and chip technologies that, it said, could boost greater capabilities in data centers and the mobile, gaming and automotive markets.   Samsung shared its memory chip development plans, stating that DRAM with a gate width of 12 nanometers will go into mass production in 2023. Its most recent, eighth-generation vertical NAND flash will go into mass production this year, while the ninth-generation vertical NAND will come out in two years.   The world's largest memory chip maker also unveiled a vision to become a total chip solutions provider by ""maximizing the synergy between"" its wide range of products, around 900 in total, that include System-on-a-Chips (SoCs), image sensors, modems, display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and power management ICs.   ""In an age that requires machines to learn and think as people do, the importance of logic chips, which play the roles of the brain, heart, nervous system and eyes, is growing to unprecedented levels,"" Park Yong-in, president and head of Samsung's System LSI Business, said.    ""Samsung will converge and combine its technology embedded in various products like SoCs, sensors, DDIs and modems, in order to lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution as a total solutions provider.""   Samsung said it will focus more on developing technologies for better performing neural processing units and graphics processing units going forward, which are key to the development of artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing.   On the memory chip front, Samsung said it will strengthen collaborations with partners, partly to advance in intelligent mobility solutions.   As part of the effort, Samsung said it will open a Samsung Memory Research Center in South Korea by the end of this year, with a plan to add more hubs in the U.S. and other parts of the world in the coming years.Attendees listen to a speech given by a Samsung executive at Samsung Tech Day 2022 at the Signia by Hilton San Jose hotel on Oct. 5, 2022, in this photo provided by the company.

Mexico and Korea have built a robust friendship for the future over the past sixty years. Formal relations were established in 1962, but the ties between our peoples go back more than a hundred years to the first Korean migration to Mexico in 1905. Furthermore, in 2022, we honored and remembered those forgotten soldiers of Mexican origin who bravely fought in the Korean War.  The relationship between the two countries has grown stronger, reflecting the maturity of our strategic partnership built in over the past six decades. The bilateral economic relation is the pillar of our partnership, as seen in the trade volume that surpassed $20 billion in 2021. In only three years, Korea has become Mexico’s third largest trade partner and one of our main foreign investors. Both governments restarted negotiations in March toward a free trade agreement.  The current relationship goes beyond the realm of economics, as it is being boosted daily at the level of citizens. Tens of thousands of young Mexican K-pop fans follow in social media what their idols do. In Korea, thousands also have a meal every day in one of the 250 restaurants that offer Mexican food. After the hardships of more than two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, people to people exchanges between the two countries are recovering.   Performers of Mariachi, a genre of Mexican music that’s been recognized as a Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2011.

They will present ""The Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán"" in Jeonju on Oct. 7 and 8. [EMBASSY OF MEXICO IN KOREA]     Music transcends language and border and brings together people of diverse cultural backgrounds. Just as K-pop identifies Korea, mariachi conjures up the image of Mexico. Its music conveys the love of the Mexican countryside — and the beauty of the country. So intrinsic is the music to the soul of our nation that it was declared as an “intangible cultural heritage” by Unesco in 2011. In other words, mariachi is a fundamental element of the culture of the Mexican people through which values, cultural assets, history and indigenous languages are transmitted from generation to generation.  The first-ever presentation of the Mariachi Vargas de Tecatitlan in Jeonju on Oct. 7 and 8, thanks to the National Intangible Heritage Center of Korea is bound to deepen the knowledge of Mexican culture among the Korean people with an exceptional high-quality performance. The Mariachi Vargas, founded in 1898 in the Mexican town of Tecalitlán, state of Jalisco, has been sharing its music in Mexico and abroad for more than 125 years. It has been featured by some of the major names in the music in the Spanish-speaking world and is considered the best mariachi band in the world.  The promotion of mutual knowledge will be key to continue fostering a better understanding between our societies in the next sixty years. People to people exchanges go both ways. The participation of Korea as a guest country in the Cervantino Festival in October in Mexico will offer the chance to many Mexicans to have a better understanding of Korean traditional culture with the K-Intangible Heritage spectacle to take place in Guanajuato on Oct. 19. Hundreds of students, professors, businessmen, artists and tourists that go both ways help consolidate solid links that will sustain our friendship for many years to come. Cultural activities, such as the presentation of the Mariachi Vargas at the K-Intangible Heritage stage, will further deepen the appreciation and friendship between the peoples of Mexico and Korea.

Samsung Electronics plans to launch 89- and 101-inch micro-LED TV models soon, following the launch of a 110-inch model last year, while LG Electronics recently completed radio wave certification for its own micro-LED TV technology and is planning to release a new product soon. However, such expansion plans may take a hit due to environmental regulations in Europe, the largest premium TV market. Under the new rules, the two companies must cut the energy consumption of 8K and micro-LED TV by at least half within the next six months to sell their products in Europe. But the industry sees this as technically impossible.  [Source : LG Electronics] 8K TVs have four times as many pixels as 4K TVs. Since the pixels are extremely dense and the area that transmits light is small, more power is required to achieve the same brightness as that of 4K.The industry is concerned that it will become increasingly difficult to fend off Chinese rivals as regulations go tighter during a severe market downturn. The global TV market is projected to decrease in both value and quantity this year compared to the previous year. According to global market research firm Omdia, global TV sales in the first half of this year already contracted by 6.6 percent on year to 92.6 million units. In terms of value, the market size fell by 12.5 percent from a year ago. TV makers could lower the luminance of 8K TVs to meet the regulations, but this would compromise the image quality significantly, making consumers turn away from such premium TVs.The local TV industry demands a government-level response to the issue, while Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) says it is trying to negotiate with the European Union regarding the new regulations.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]		"

All members work as global ambassadors for luxury brands, Jenny for Chanel, Lisa for Celine, Jisoo for Dior, and Rosé for Saint Laurent. If BTS penetrated the millennial and Gen Z market, which is sensitive to diversity, Blackpink is achieving global celebrity. Another strength is that members have experiences of living abroad, including Lisa being Thai, and they speak good English, Japanese and Thai.  Along with Blackpink’s global success, the girl groups are the trend of the domestic market. Eight of the top ten songs on Melon music chart between September 19 and 25 were songs by Blackpink, Girls Generation, Ive and New Jeans. Ive and New Jeans are newcomers who created a sensation with easy listening popular music rather than the powerful K-pop preferred abroad.  The strong push of the girl groups breaks the old convention that basic traction for idol fandom is based on fan girls’ love for male idols. The fans of the girl groups expanded from the existing “uncles” to “aunts.” On Aladdin, pre-orders for Ive’s After Like album was by 69 percent female customers and 31 percent male customers. Among the women, customers in their 40s made up 25 percent, followed by teens at 22 percent. It is evidence that women in their 40s with spending power actively consume the music by young girl groups. Women like female idols, support them as if raising them, confirm sisterhood, and admire them. As Blackpink shows, the essence of admiration is the super celeb image achieved with outstanding natural beauty, good family backgrounds, global sense and sophisticated manners and luxury goods.  Traditionally, the key to K-pop fandom business is attracting female consumers willing to open their wallets for the stars. Boy bands with more female fans than male fans always had dominance over girl groups mostly with male fans who are stingy.  But now the world has changed. As female fans who open their wallets for girl groups have emerged, agencies focus on girl groups. Girl groups also have a strength in risk management. There are girl group members who were involved in school violence, but compared to male idols, there are fewer cases of being in trouble in the private lives. They can be active longer because they don’t serve in the military. As the world changes, agencies and the industry change. How long will the “girl group dominance” last? It is the most eye-catching scene in K-pop today.  "
[Newsmaker] Chung leads Hyundai’s transformation toward software-powere...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000240520?sid=104,"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 15:56:00 +0900","2 years after seizing leadership, Chung Euisun revamps carmaker’s image, turns W110tr empire into driver of mobility innovationHyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Euisun (Hyundai Motor Group)For decades, Hyundai Motor and Kia, two brands under South Korean automotive empire Hyundai Motor Group, had long been perceived as manufacturers of low-end, entry-level vehicles.The global awareness of the Korean car brands, however, has changed in recent years with many projecting them today as mobility innovators and a reliable sources of quality. At the center of such significant change is Chung Euisun, third-generation chaebol scion and the son of former chairman Chung Mong-koo, who begins Friday his third year as executive chairman of the 110 trillion won empire.Under his leadership for two past years, Hyundai Motor has become the world’s third-largest carmaker, outpacing Japan’s Toyota and Germany’s Volkswagen Group by selling an accumulated 3.29 million cars globally. The Korean automaker had been in the top five for the last 12 years.Hyundai and Kia’s record sales of 106.5 trillion won and net profit of 7.8 trillion won are raising hopes that the Korean duo can reach 200 trillion won in sales and operating profit of 17 trillion won for the first time this year. This figure would mean a 23 percent increase in sales and 280 percent jump in operating profit compared to 2020, the year Chung took office.The solid profit has laid the foundation for Chung’s ambition to turn the carmaker into a smart mobility provider that puts it up against EV competitors like Tesla, who sold the most EVs globally -- 6.6 million -- last year. Hyundai sold the fifth most at 4.7 million.On Wednesday, Hyundai Motor Group announced that it would invest 18 trillion won by 2030 for software-focused mobility development and offer customized connected car services such as over-the-air software updates for all cars by 2025, vowing to make sure that all Hyundai and Kia cars are up to date at all times.In comparison, all Tesla cars began receiving over-the-air software updates that add new features and enhance existing ones over Wi-Fi from 2012.“Through big data created from millions of connected cars, we will create unprecedented values and possibilities, offering customers with customized software updates and subscription services,” Hyundai said in a statement.Hyundai said it would also develop software-based mobility devices and solutions to enter the future mobility and logistics market, so that its future mobility lineup, comprising those such as the RoboTaxi, advanced air mobility, purpose built vehicles and robotics, will sync to each other.“By shifting the group’s business focus toward software development, Hyundai Motor Group would see improved profitability in the new mobility ecosystem,” said a Hyundai Motor official.“There is no doubt that Tesla is the sample model for Hyundai and it is true that the Korean carmaker is constantly seeking what it could do the best to become like Tesla,” said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of automotive engineering from Daelim University.It won’t be an easy road ahead for Hyundai to become a software-focused automaker taking on Tesla who recorded double-digit operating profit at 14.6 percent in the Q2, compared to Korean carmaker’s 8.3 percent, according to market experts.“Overcoming Hyundai’s manufacturing-optimized workforce, decision-making structure and working culture as well as creating software-based working system with partnering firms are hurdles for Hyundai to reborn as so-called Korean Tesla,” said Kim.A Hyundai Motor Group official admitted during a Q&A session with journalists Wednesday that it has been difficult to establish standards for software updates with partnering firms because they needed to agree on the same starting line for the standardization and said that the corporation was in the process of making new standards together with its partners. Hyundai currently works with thousands of subcontractors for auto parts.Chung sought to transform Hyundai Motor Group, notorious for its militant culture, even before he took over. He promoted open thinking among engineers by hiring foreign professionals and design gurus. Market experts have credited Chung for pushing ahead with the luxury brand Genesis and improving the product mix with eco-friendly models in the global market.“Due to COVID-19 and the supply crunch of automotive chips, the automaker diverted toward selling high-priced Genesis and SUV models, actively working on normalizing production and sales by even paying more incentives to dealers in the overseas market,” said an industry insider.Hyundai also initiated various M&As, penetrating into the autonomous driving, advanced air mobility and robotics sectors, and launched a software-focused transformation across their product portfolio."
